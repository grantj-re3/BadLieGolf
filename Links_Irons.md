## How to play irons in wet/soft conditions

1. :thumbsup: [The Dogwood Golf Club: JR Ross | Everything you need to know about golfing in wet conditions! (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUWCaNPs9bI)
   - Local rule 14: Mark, lift, clean and place | Rule 16.3: Embedded Ball |
     Rule 16.1: Abnormal Course Conditions including temporary water [previously called casual water]
   - Choke down on the grip one inch | Play the ball in the middle of your stance
   - Stand taller | Hover your club (don't "ground your club") | Catch the ball above the ground [but below the equator]
   - Hit down and through the ball | Low point of your swing on the target side of the ball
   - Swing at 80% for a better swing and solid contact | Use more club

   - From the fairway: Use more club | Grip down the handle a fraction | Smooth [80%] swing | Weight on the lead leg
     so you get ball first, ground second | Put the ball back in your stance (one ball max) to help eliminate fat shots

   - Use *discovery swings* before your real shot to help decide how far back in your stance the ball should be

1. [Lewis Hackett Golf | How to play in wet conditions (video) | 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h51wSzCNOI)
   - Fairway shot: Keep chest over the ball during backswing (instead of "loading up" on the trail side) | Drill: Play a shot with a towel 3 ball-widths behind your ball
   - Pitch shot: Move ball back about 1 ball-width | Divot will be deeper | Ball trajectory will be lower
   - Chip shot: Use less loft | Move ball back in your stance | Toe down clubhead [i.e. upright shaft] |
     Open clubface slightly | Take the *club* away more upright [rather than around the body]
   - Belly wedge shot: Use when you wish to putt from thick/wet grass | Use your most lofted wedge | Open the clubface |
     Use a putting stroke to hit the ball at the equator with the leading edge of the club | Alternative descriptions
