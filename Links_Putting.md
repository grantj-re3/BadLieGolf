- Have a correct and consistent setup:
  * Grip more along the *life line* which promotes:
    + less wristy putts [hence more repeatable speed]
    + elbows tucking into body [hence more repeatable line]
  * Grip loosely; just enough to support the putter
  * Stance about shoulder width
  * Ball under the left eye which promotes striking the ball while putter head is moving up
  * Eyes slightly inside the line of the ball-to-target line (if you stand too far from the
    ball the putter head moves on more of an arc (viewed from above) during the stroke)
  * Hands should be over the ball (viewed from the front). [In other words, you have a *tiny* forward shaft lean.]
- Rock your shoulders; do not allow the body to move forward during the stoke
- You need to consistently hit the middle of the club face
  * Drill:
    + Add a rubber band on each side of the (putter head) sweet spot
    + When you practice putting, you will feel when you miss the sweet spot
- You need good rhythm [i.e. sequence of movement] and tempo [i.e. speed]
- Preshot routine the same (and so same duration) for 3 foot and 30 foot putts; the preshot routine starts after you have decided on your line
- Use a ball with an alignment mark
- For long putts: Consider feeling what speed to hit the putt in advance by:
  * taking your setup (but away from the ball)
  * looking at the hole
  * practice the speed of your stroke [since for long putts, speed is more important than line]
- *Matt's* takeaways from the lesson:
  * Wider stance.
  * Ball under my left eye.
  * Hands over the ball (not ahead or behind).
  * Line on the ball removes one variable - alignment.
  * Longer backstroke and less jab.
  * Let the putter head release.
  * Consistent strike and preshot routine are key.
  * Stand closer to the ball.

   Things to try while on the course playing golf. *Do your practice while you are playing*.

   1. Read the putt of the other players in your group
   1. Find the high [and low] point of the green and course
   1. Read your chip shots like a putt
      * Also where would you like your chip to stop to make your putt easier
   1. Practice drill for quiet hands
   1. Pick a spot 1 foot ahead of the ball

1. [MrShortGame | Top 5 Green Reading Tips for Golf! (video) | 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNfavF72bQI)

   1. As you approach the green, look for the highest point
   1. As you approach the green, look for the lowest point
   1. Watch your playing partners, especially as their ball rolls within 10 feet of the hole
   1. Make sure the info about the green matches up (i.e. makes sense) when you look at the line from behind your ball
   1. Look at the grain of the grass

1. [MrShortGame | Putting Drill to Make More Birdies! (The 20 foot putt) (video) | 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_PR18lvbmY)
   * Pace out 20 feet
   * Warm up by:
     + putting with one hand
     + using alignment stick across shoulders
     + feel shoulder rotation is correct
   * Drill:
     + You will be putting from a marked point on the green, through a
       gate to the hole
     + Mark a point on the practice green with sharpie [or ball marker
       or coin which allows you to adjust the position]
     + About a foot in front of the mark, make a "gate" by inserting 2
       tees just wider than the golf ball
     + Lie an alignment stick 3 feet past the hole
     + The objective is to putt from the mark, through the gate and
       either into the hole or beyond the hole but stop before the
       alignment stick
     + Repeat with marker 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 feet behind the gate (21, 22, 23, 24, 25 feet from the hole)

1. [MrShortGame | Best Lag Putting Drill! (40-60 feet) (video) | 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3C2z75xVyY)
   * Make 4 quadrants/areas at the edge of the practice green (using 5 clubs)
   * Pace out 40 feet
   * Putt 5 balls into each area
   * Next day repeat for 50 feet
   * Next day repeat for 60 feet


## My putting thoughts

I confess that I putt with the [claw grip](Links_PuttingClawSaw.md).
I am not a great putter but I feel my putting has improved since
changing to this grip 8 months ago (in late 2021).


### Rock your shoulders when putting

I prefer the feeling of "rocking" my shoulders when putting rather than
"rotating" the shoulders. (This is a little controversial as some putting
coaches advocate the opposite!)

* During the backswing I have the sensation that my left shoulder is moving
  down (towards the ground) and my right shoulder is moving up (towards the
  sky).
* During the downswing and follow through I have the sensation that my left
  shoulder is moving up (towards the sky) and my right shoulder is moving
  down (towards the ground)

### A good putt starts with a good takeaway

Assuming you've setup properly for your putt...

* It is almost impossible for your putter head to follow the correct path
  towards the ball if you took the putter away (from address) on the wrong
  path.
* It is easier to adjust the speed of your putt by adjusting the length of
  your takeaway (and follow through)... rather than have a similar length
  takeaway for every putting speed. See Aussie Golf Pros equal 
  backswing/followthrough link above.
