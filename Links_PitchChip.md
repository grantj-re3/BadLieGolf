   1. Keep ~70% of your weight on left/lead leg. Do not transfer weight
      from right leg to left leg.
   1. Do not *rotate hands open* during back swing.
   1. During backswing, arms do not go above horizontal. If the shot
      needs to go further, use a longer club.
   1. Club must be accelerating at impact.
   1. Optional (secret sauce): "Loosen the screw" (twist the wrist to
      close club face slightly) before the down swing. The ball
      launches lower with more spin.

   Also don't keep your head down after you strike the ball. Instead, rotate the hips/body **after** you strike the ball.


1. [MrShortGame - Matt Fisher | Top 5 Tips for the 80 Yard Golf Shot (video) | 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH74wwBcv2Y)

   1. Do not use your 80 yard full-shot club. Use 1 or 2 clubs more (less
      lofted) to give more margin for error.
   1. Setup in the center of your stance.
      * Hands in the center.
      * Ball in the center.
   1. Use a shallow golf swing.
      * The hands stay low.
      * [Almost] just turning the body.
      * Shallow divot.
   1. **Very important. Keep at least 70% of your weight on left/lead/front
      foot. Keep it there for the entire back swing and forward swing.**
      * You should still rotate.
   1. Hit low with hands low.
      * Think "low".
      * In the finish position (you have rotated to face the target and)
        your hands are by your belt buckle.
      * Finishing low forces your body to rotate.
      * Hands are *not* high near your shoulder.

   Similar to the 30 and 80 yard tips above.

   1. No wrist cock. (No wrist hinge.)
   1. Shallow back swing. Hands are not up near your shoulder during back swing. Take the club back shallow and "on the inside".
   1. Narrow stance. Stand tall.
   1. Open the club face a degree or two (so the bounce hits the ground before the club face hits the ball).

   Tips and fixes:

   1. Course management: When approaching the green (usually with a full shot)
      ensure your miss leaves you with a chance for "up and down". That is,
      miss to the position (i.e. left, right, front, back) where you have
      "green to work with".
   1. Course management: Assess the chip rather than take out your
      favourite/standard chipping club.
      * Read the green
      * Take the club which will land ~5 feet past the front of the green
        and let the ball run to the hole
   1. For (especially short?) chips, you *must* allow the *bounce* of the
      club to hit the ground, ***not the leading edge***. So, either:
      * do *not* have your hands forward (very much), or
      * if you do want your hands forward, open the club face
   1. For (especially short?) chips, accelerate through impact as follows:
      * feel as though the weight of the club head is falling due to gravity
        until you strike the ball
      * accelerate after striking the ball (when arms are about 6 o'clock
        to 4 o'clock)
   1. Do not "stay down" after impact. 
      * Rotate towards the target
      * "Open up" the left shoulder


1. [MrShortGame - Matt Fisher | How to Hit the Simple Golf Flop Shot! (video) | 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR-nMi4e9ko)

   Simple version of flop shot:
   - For situations where you are on a "tight" lie. Hence you can practice
     from a mat.
   - High, soft spinning shot with little or no run after it lands. But not
     the full flop shot.
   - 60° wedge.
   - Open the club face.
   - Aim 30-45° left/open.
   - Narrow stance. Less than shoulder width.
   - Ball in center or slightly forward in your stance.
   - Hands in center or slightly forward.
   - Back swing and down swing:
     * No wrist hinge.
     * No elbow bend.
     * Feel the "bounce" of the club hit the ground. The leading edge of the
       club *must not* hit the ground.


1. [Top Speed Golf - Clay Ballard | How To Hit Chip Shots Around The Green | Easy Technique | 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMzVn7bkNqE)

   - 1m11s: The putt chip (10 yards max)
     * Upright shaft; only toe brushes the ground
     * 7-9 iron or hybrid
     * Legs locked "putting stroke"
     * Little forward shaft lean
   - 5m04: Normal chip (~80 yards max)
     * Fluid stroke; knees, hips and shoulders rotate
     * Heels almost touching
     * Open stance
     * Let wrists stay "soft"
   - 7m27s: Low super spin wedge shot (40-80 yards)
     * Get the body to open up during follow through
     * Natural forward shaft lean
     * 9m07s: Cheat stance or drill stance; 45° open
     * Very little face rotation
   - 11m22s: Easy chipping
     * Keep knees moving (and hips and shoulders)
     * Where to place the ball? Do some practice chips with eyes closed.
     * Eyes must stay still until after contact

1. [Danny Maude | CHIP SHOTS Around the Green are MUCH EASIER with this Short Game Technique | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOAHQY-Fr0)
   - This chip and run shot typically covers 70-80% of shots around the green
   - Use a different club for more/less run
   - Stand with feet together
   - Weight on the front foot
   - Ball towards the back foot
   - Nearly vertical shaft (looking down the target line); heel of club head is slightly off the ground
   - [Me: Because the shaft is nearly vertical and the club head is closer to your feet,
     your hands will be lower down the shaft than normal. Hence *you will need to compensate* by:
     * holding the club lower on the grip (which will in turn reduce the effective shaft-length
       causing the ball to travel a little shorter), or
     * standing taller (particularly if the above suggestion means your hands are below the bottom of the grip), or
     * doing a little of both]
   - [Me: If the heel of your club head is slightly off the ground (and the toe is lower) as suggested, you have
     changed the lie-angle and this will promote a shot which goes a little right of the target line
     (for a right handed player).  Hence *you will need to compensate* by aiming a little left of the
     target line.]
   - No forward shaft lean (so the bounce of the club is in play)
   - Almost a pendulum action but with a confident little release/pop (not a long and careful motion)
   - Very little shoulder/body rotation needed
   - During the downswing/follow through, the butt of the handle moves forward and up (in an "L" shape)

     * Drill: Pitch and rotate with right heel off the ground
   - [Golf University - Matt Cleverdon | How To Spin Your Pitch Shots | 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aZhcChXsnk)
     * Soft ball
     * Clean grooves on club face
     * Do *not* chop down in an attempt to create spin
     * "Land a plane" - "come in shallow"; "back wheels land before front wheels"
     * neutral shaft lean
     * weight on front/left foot
     * tilt handle up slightly so bottom of club is flat on the ground
     * rotate body
     * right hand pushes the club head under the ball
     * shallow divot
   - [Golf University - Matt Cleverdon | How To Control Your Pitching Ball Flights | 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgqjhYjCN64)
     * Ball position forward with negative shaft lean
     * Ball position back with forward/positive shaft lean
   - [Golf University - Shane McHenry | How to Vary Your Pitching Ball Flights | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNh3J5ts040)
     * Club selection: 62° lob wedge or 52° gap wedge
