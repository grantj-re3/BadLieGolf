     * Driving distance is proportional to club head speed. In other words, if you want to drive
       the ball longer, you need to increase your club head speed (all other things being equal).
     * On average, golfers with a lower handicap have a higher driver club head speed

   - This article is mostly about principles rather than technical details.
   - Speed training criteria: Have the intent to swing very very fast | Have a device for speed feedback | Insert breaks during sessions
   - For example, 10 swings at maximum speed 2 times a week might be enough of a stimulus for a beginner to see improvements in speed...
     someone 6 months into speed training may need 30-50 swings at maximum speed two or three times a week to see improvement.
   - It is a good idea to start on the conservative side in terms of weekly volume. I recommend doing as little as required while still
     seeing progress. This volume can then be gradually increased over time as necessary.
