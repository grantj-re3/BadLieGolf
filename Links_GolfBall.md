# Golf balls

This is mainly about technical aspects of golf balls, so it covers:

- ball speed, trajectory, spin
- test results, compression, dimple pattern, fitting, etc.

   - Key Findings
     1. Soft is Slow, But …
     2. Soft Doesn’t Spin
     3. If It Spins Off The Driver, It Spins Off The Wedge
     4. Forget About Launch Angle, Trajectory [i.e. launch angle, height and descent angle] is The Thing
     5. For Many, The Best Answers Are In The Middle
     6. Golf Ball Models Are Significantly Different
   - High Swing Speed Golfers: Observations
     * the Top 10 [Distance Off The Tee] shows a mix of high-, mid- and low-compression offerings
     * low spin properties of low-compression balls can help offset [in terms of Distance Off The Tee] the significantly lower ball speed for high spin golfers
     * At driver speeds, the firmest balls were the fastest
     * At these [iron] speeds, trajectory and spin properties play a more significant role in total distance.
     * As we slow to iron speeds, high-compression balls lose their speed advantage.
     * The balls that were high spinning off the driver... are also spinny off the irons.
     * Low compression means lower spin
   - Mid Swing Speed Golfers: Observations
     * Firmer offerings... achieve distance through longer carry while softer offerings... rely on additional roll (due to lower spin) to maximize distance.
     * The firmest balls are the fastest balls
     * ...suggesting little direct correlation between speed and spin.
     * The [mid-iron] distance comes with reduced spin and shallower descent angles, suggesting stopping power could be an issue for some.
     * the fastest balls [mid-iron] are a mix of high- and low-compression models.
     * Spin is spin and it’s consistent throughout the bag [e.g. for driver and mid-iron]
   - Slower Swing Speed Golfers: Observations
     * the longest balls for this group were largely above 85 compression.
     * Golfers in this swing speed range often benefit [for driver distance] from higher launch with more spin so low-compression balls are not always the best option.
     * Even at relatively slow driver speeds, firmer balls are fast with the majority being above 95 compression.
     * At our lowest [swing] speed, the longest balls [for irons] are almost all low-compression offerings.
     * For slower swing speed players, higher spin on iron shots is often desirable so, while low-compression balls can provide more distance, the low-spin properties may not be ideal.
   - WEDGE – 55 Yard Shot: Observations
     * Balls that we would classify as spinny off the driver and irons also produced high spin rates on 55-yard wedge shots.
     * The lowest wedge spin was found among the low-compression offerings.
   - Ball Speed Versus Compression: Observations
     * At all three driver speeds tested, the highest-compression golf balls... produced the fastest ball speeds. This suggests slower swing speed golfers are still able to compress the core with a driver.
     * As iron speeds drop into the mid-range of our test, the low-compression balls are faster... the lower-compression balls gain speed because of the firmer covers and mantles.
   - “Soft” Ball Recommendations
     * Low compression isn’t for everyone and, frankly, we believe they’re not the best fit for most golfers.
   - Reader Asked Questions
     * What’s the right compression for my swing speed?
     * Does handicap matter when choosing a golf ball?
     * ...
     * How do I find the right golf ball for my game?
     * If the cover of my ball is damaged, will it affect performance?
     * Do the pros play the same golf ball I buy off the shelf?
