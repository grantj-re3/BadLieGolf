   - Similar to Dr Kwon
   - Most professional golfers have up-tempo swings
   - Step drill
   - Convert step drill into real swing

1. [Be Better Golf | THE DOWN AND AROUND MOVE! Milo Lines: "MY KEYS to BE BETTER" (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXjm3nvyylU)
   - Similar to Dr Kwon
   - Right shoulder does backstoke (not freestyle)
   - Spine moves to produce backswing/downswing. Spine angle is not constant.
   - What powers the swing? "**Left side of body** moving down and around" [together]
   - Build pattern first: Club stays out and away; body turns.
   - Then step drills
