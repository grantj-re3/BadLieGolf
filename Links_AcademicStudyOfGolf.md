     * [11m15s] Five characteristics of Quiet Eye
       1. Fixate your gaze on a very specific location: The most effective for
          putting is the contact point at the back of the ball.
       1. The fixation must start a second or more before the backswing commences.
       1. The fixation must continue on the same spot (where the ball was prior
          to impact) until the ball has travelled a metre or so (after impact).

     1. What I would suggest is that when you are standing over the ball
        take a deep breath and push your breath out.
     1. Make sure your putter grip is light, then take a hard focus on
        the back of the ball, laser-like focus, pick out a dimple, pause
        until you are ready to go and then swing.
     1. Make your putting stroke, but the entire time focus on a dimple
        on the back of the ball.
     1. Switch your mind off. I usually say ... focus with the quiet eye,
        execute with the quiet mind.
     1. Make a putt and as you are looking at the ball, don’t look up as
        you make contact.  And before you look up give it a quick rating
        out of ten and then look up and see how you did.

   [Human Kinetics | Joan Vickers | Perception, Cognition, and Decision Training: The Quiet Eye in Action, First Edition | 2007](https://us.humankinetics.com/blogs/excerpt/quiet-eye-in-golf-leads-to-better-performance)
   - Of all the gaze within the scan path in golf... only one has emerged
     as an indicator of both higher levels of skill and accuracy, and that
     is the final fixation on the ball prior to the backswing
   - The onset of the quiet eye occurred before the backswing, and it was
     located on either the back of the ball or the top
