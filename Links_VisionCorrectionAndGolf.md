# Vision correction and golf

## The problem

When I got my latest pair of single vision lens glasses (not bifocal or multifocal/progressive) 
my distance vision in normal (non-golf) situations improved, however

- I was suddenly unable to align and sink putts (even from about 1 metre). After several weeks,
  the situation did not improve.
- I confirmed that when I take my putting stance with eyes above a horizontal line on the floor
  (simulating a straight line between a ball and a hole 2.5 metres away) the line appears to be
  curved.  With my glasses removed, the same line appears to be straight (but blurred due to my
  poor eyesight).
- The line on the floor appears to be straight if:
  1. I place the glasses near the tip of my nose, or
  1. I tilt the glasses frames forward so the arms are a couple of centimetres above my ears, or
  1. I bend my upper body and neck so that my face and lenses are roughly horizontal
- The new lenses have a higher refractive index than my old ones, hence are thiner
- The Optometrist Assistant was able to improve the situation slightly by tilting the
  top of the lenses further forward than they were originally


## Potential solutions

- Use one of the above options which makes the line on the floor appear to be straight
  (although I am not keen on any of them)
- Replace the lenses and/or frames so that the optical center of the lens is lower and
  the lenses are tilted further forward (although this may adversely affect vision in
  non-golf/non-putting situations)
- Consider using contact lenses for golf (but some people say the lenses can dry out
  before they complete 18 holes)
- Consider laser eye surgery
