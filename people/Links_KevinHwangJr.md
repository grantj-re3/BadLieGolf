   - Focus on lower body and arms, the upper body will open up (rotate) naturally during the downswing
   - Pull the club down with the lower body | When we reach the setup position then throw the arms towards the target
   - Pull the club down with the lead lat and lead pelvis; this moves the club "into the slot" while maintaining the arm/club angles

   - Intro: Loosen grip pressure and arms | Arms feel liked rope or noodles |
     We want the club head (not hands) to swing back and forth [L-to-L drill]
   - **Grip for every drill**: Grip in the fingers | Only the bottom 3 fingers in each hand (thumb and index fingers off)
   - [2m01s] Drill #1: Swing L-to-L | Repeat
   - [3m35s] Drill #2: Start at P7.5 (where lead arm and shaft are straight) | Swing to the top | Downswing to P7.5 | Repeat
   - [5m27s] Drill #3: Sequence without a club: [7m58s] Start at P5 | Thumb up on lead hand pointed to the sky |
     Push butt back | Rotate back to setup position (about P6) with thumb still pointed to the sky |
     Release: swing arms towards the target

   - [0m58s] Hit the ball with the weight of the club head:
     | During the downswing, let go of the angles you created
     | Feel that the club head drops *underneath* the golf ball
   - [4m24s] Supinated release:
     | If the clubhead remains outside of the hands, the ball will not hook left
     | Use the wrists to deloft the clubface
     | Freezer drill
