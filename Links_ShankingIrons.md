# How to stop shanking irons

If you are hitting irons 45Â° or so to the right (for a right handed player)
and you expect a cure from the links below, you should first ensure that
the fault is due to a shank and not something else (like hitting the ball
off the toe of the club)!

   1. Are you standing too close to the ball?
   1. Awareness and perception of where the ball is
   1. Feel like the contact point will be on the toe
      * *Drill*: Place tee outside the toe of the club face
   1. Is your balance moving towards your toes? [Are you falling towards the ball?]
      * Drill: Lift the toes of both feet during your swing
   1. Is your body tense?
      * Particularly hands, arms, shoulders, chest, neck
      * Drill: Practice swings with your eyes closed and be aware of any tension
   1. Hands too far from your body at impact
      * Drill: Use a pool noodle to confirm that the hands do not move too far from your body
   1. Does your club face stay too open?
      * Check the toe of the club points to the sky (or slightly closed?) during the backswing when shaft is parallel to ground

   - *Check your setup*, 3m04s:
     * Stand in a balanced position at address. Don't stand too close or too far from the ball.
       + Stand up straight
       + Club parallel with the ground
       + Handle (i.e. left hand) is about a hand-and thumb distance from belt buckle
       + Tilt from the hips until the club touches the ground
       + Slightly flex the knees
     * Close eyes and feel equal weight between toes and heel
     * Dangle right arm (so it does not hold the club); you should be able to move the right hand onto the handle
       without any manipulation (i.e. by just moving the hand towards the target; not towards or away from your body)
   - Check your club face isn't open, 5m04s:
     * Check the club face is *parallel to your spine angle* during the backswing when shaft is parallel to ground
   - Build awareness of where the ball strikes the face, 6m16s:
     * Drill: Place a second ball [or tee] outside the toe of the club face

   - Setup: Weight towards the heels of your feet
   - Backswing: Stay on your heels
   - Downswing: Stay on your heels as you push your butt back

   - Use proper golf posture:
     * Stand up straight
     * Put hands on our thighs
     * Hinge our thighs back until our toes come up
     * Add a little flex to our knees

     * Common cause: During the takeaway, the club head moves too far to the inside
     * Move the club head and handle in the same direction during takeaway
       + Do not break the wrists (much) during the takeaway
     * Drill: Use Plane Slider (with a weight which slides up/down the shaft) to confirm backswing goes up (fairly vertical)

     * Why are you shanking your chip shots?
       + Forward shaft lean is excessive, or
       + During the takeaway, the club head moves too far to the inside

   - Drill:
     * Alignment stick with one end in the ground and other end pointing towards the target
     * Other end is halfway between right knee and ground and just inside your shin
     * During downswing the right shin should not touch the alignment stick;
       instead the lower right leg should move left then rotate (i.e. right knee
       points towards your left knee)

   - Keep the club head in front of your body the whole time (backswing and downswing) when pitching
   - Cocking the wrists is ok
   - Do not roll the wrists (i.e. open the club face); the toe of the club should point to the sky
     during the backswing when shaft is parallel to ground

1. [GolfUniversity - Matt Cleverdon | How to Overcome the Pitching Shanks (video) | 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozFQ8Cm26Q)
   - To avoid falling forward, consider hitting the pitch with your left foot toes "in the air"

1. Me
   - Symptoms:
     * I have a tendancy to shank full-shot and three-quarter-shot
       wedges, e.g. pitching wedge, gap wedge, sand wedge
     * Sometimes I have shanked 3 or 4 wedges while playing 18 holes!
   - The following seems to work for me:
     * At address, bias the ball towards the toe of the club.
       Typically, I align the middle of the club face with the
       near edge of the ball (instead of the middle of the ball).
     * I have poor balance when hitting full shots and tend to fall
       towards the ball. Hence, concentrate on feeling my weight
       more towards my heels at:
       + address
       + backswing
       + downswing


# The opposite problem: hitting off the club face toe
