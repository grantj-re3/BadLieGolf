## DRIVER SERIES 

He is often comparing the driver swing to a 7-iron swing, so we can
learn something about iron shots here too.

1. [PART 1: Set Up Position | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdp-flHvhdY)
   - Driver: The ball is *not* on the ground | We do *not*
     want to hit down | The driver is much longer
   - *Iron setup*: Ball position slightly to the left of cenre |
     Head is mostly behind the ball | Weight is fairly even
     (about 55% on the lead side) | We hit down on the ball |
     Radius (low point) is in front of the ball
   - *Driver setup*: Weight is same as for an iron (55% on the lead side) |
     (1) Ball position in line with the lead shoulder |
     (2) Stance is wider | (3) Head is further behind the ball |
     (4) Longest/lowest point is at the ball (i.e. at impact)
   - *Iron setup (side view)*: Weight is in the center of the foot |
     Slight knee bend | Hands are directly below the shoulders |
     Flat lower back and slightly rounded upper back |
     Shoulders *not* pinched together
   - *Driver setup (side view)*: Posture is the same as 7-iron |
     (1) Hands are a little outside of the shoulder line |
     (2a) Shoulders must remain parallel to your feet line (even
     though the ball is positions further forward) | (2b) Forearms
     must also remain in alignment

1. [PART 2: Backswing | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PP5vA1XTOE)
   - Content: Rotation | Extension | Sway
   - *Chest rotation*: Allows hands to move higher | Allows hands to
     move further behind your body (i.e. depth) | Helps prevent swinging
     "over the top" (resulting in steepness and an out-to-in path) |
     See *HOW TO MAKE ROTATION EASIER IN THE GOLF SWING!* link above
   - *Extension*: Not enough extension causes the head to move off the ball |
     ... and limits the height of your hands | Too much extension causes
     a reverse pivot
   - Check point 1: An alignment stick perpendicular to your chest should
     be slightly above horizontal at the top of your backswing
   - Check point 2: At the top of your backswing, there should be a small
     space (say 15cm) between your back and a vertical line above the ball (from the front view)
   - Check point 3: At the top of your backswing, your head should not
     have moved left/right (or back/forward)... but it may rotate
   - *Sway*: The hips are permitted to move slightly away from the target
     at the beginning of the backswing, but by the time the backswing
     is completed, they should have returned to the address position
     or even be slightly closer to the target (i.e. re-centered)
