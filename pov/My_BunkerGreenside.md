# My greenside bunker shots

What works for me (in Aug 2024)...

## Soft-to-firm sand

E.g. Soft sand which is slighly damp or slightly compacted

Main setup:

- I prefer my weight towards my heels (and keep it there) [1]
- Weight over my lead/left leg (and keep it there)
- Lock my lead/left elbow (and keep it locked until after impact)
- I prefer to address the ball so the centre of the ball is closer to
  the toe of the club head (as I have a tendency to catch too much
  sand and I *feel* I catch less sand this way) [2]

Other setup (which I tend to do without thinking):

- Slightly open the club face (to about 1 o'clock). You may need
  to open it further to avoid a steep bunker wall and lip.
- Open the stance so that the opened club face points towards
  the target
- Ball in line with my sternum (after I have moved my weight over
  my lead/left leg)
- Right hand grip is very weak
- I intend to make first contact with the sand about 2" behind
  the ball
- Address the ball with the club head hovering above the sand and
  a few inches behind the intended entry point into the sand

Motion:

- Almost pause at the top
- **Do not allow the hips to move down as the club head moves down.**
  Instead, rotate the hips while keeping them level during the
  backswing and downswing. [1]
- Hit/splash a parcel of sand forward several metres (i.e. along the
  swing line)
- I try to keep my legs and head very quiet/still during the backswing
  and downswing
- Finish facing the target


Notes:

1. I suspect this is natural for most golfers so is not worthy of a
   special mention for them.
2. I suspect most golfers don't do this.
