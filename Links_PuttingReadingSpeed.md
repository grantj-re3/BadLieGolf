## DIY Stimpmeters + fun facts

   - This design appears to work in a similar manner to real/approved Stimpmeters

   - An ad hoc Stimpmeter for measuring the speed of an indoor putting mat (assumes the putting surface is flat)

   - Design/construction omits detail, *but...*
   - The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixNJ6EJFYiQ) shows some fascinating stimp numbers
     * Green 9.5 | Rug 15, 12, 11
     * Linolium 28 | Wooden floor 31 | Pool table 16.3
     * Tall lawn 0.6 | Football synthetic turf 3.2 | Tennis court 14
     * Bitumen car park 48 | Bowling lane 60+
     * Carpet 13, 6.7, 5.9, 11
   - My conclusions:
     * If you ever need to putt over hard-compacted ground (similar to a bitumen car park)
       which is about 5 times faster than a real green, then just pretend that the
       hard ground portion is also a putting green which is 5 times shorter in length
     * E.g. 10m hard ground plus 12m on the green ≡ 10m/5 + 12m = 14 metres of normal green speed
     * If you ever need to putt over fairway grass (similar to football synthetic turf)
       which is about 3 times slower than a real green, then just pretend that the
       fairway grass portion is also a putting green which is 3 times longer in length
     * E.g. 2m fairway grass + 12m on the green ≡ 2mx3 + 12m = 18 metres of normal green speed
       (but maybe you should be chipping these shots?)

   - An ad hoc Stimpmeter; uses a smartphone Inclinometer app to achieve a 20° incline
   - Perhaps more than 18 inches difference between the measurement in one direction
     compared to the opposite direction?
   - Observation 1: Cutting the green can increase the speed significantly e.g. from 6.6 to 8.9 = 2.3 feet (+35%).
   - Observation 2: The direction of the cut (i.e. grain) compared to the direction of your putt
     can change the speed of your putt e.g. from 8.9 to 7.4 = 1.5 feet (-17% to +20%).
   - Observation 3: Rolling the green can increase the speed significantly e.g. from 7.4 to 9.9 = 2.5 feet (+34%).

     Another technique would be to have a consistent stance width and
     measure your stroke length in reference to the position of your feet.


## My clues to assess the green speed

Major factors

- Watch others who putt before you
- Assess up/down slope
- Measure the ball-to-hole distance (in paces)
  * You can get to know how hard/soft to roll your putt
    for various distances and for various stimp numbers
- How long is the grass?
  * Feel it with your hand
  * Did you just see the green keeper cutting the green?
- How damp is the grass?
  * Feel it with your hand
  * Did it rain in the last few hours?
  * Were the greens watered in the last few hours?
  * Are the greens getting faster/drier as you play in the morning
    or slower/damper as you play in the afternoon?
- Have the greens been sanded?
  * Wet sand or bumpy greens can make the green speed slower
  * A lot of dry sand can make the green speed faster
- Somewhat similar to the practice green
  * Putt on it
  * Feel it with your hand

Minor factors (usually)

- Grain direction, including:
  * Mowing direction
  * Direction of scarified furrows
- Wind direction
- How fast were the greens last time you played?
