     + 8m32s ***Excellent video!*** Golf swing for seniors; build your custom swing (to fit your range of motion)
     + 24m03s How to hit a power draw
   - Range of motion tests:
     + Lift your left heel to turn shoulders more during backswing
     + Test how high you can lift both your arms
     + Open the left foot more at address (~45째) if your left foot internal rotation angle
       is poor
     + Test if you can rotate your head 90째 to the left; if not, consider looking at the
       ball with the left eye only at the end of the backswing

   - 3 videos combined into one:
     + 0m13s How to use hips
     + 7m43s Move body away from the target to create more club head speed
     + 15m50s Use both upper and lower body to generate more club head speed
       * 16m47s PRGR (Black) Portable Launch Monitor
   - Release late (don't "cast")
   - During downswing:
     * knees will move so that they point forward
     * then hips will rotate
   - At impact and follow through:
     + feel that the hands are moving through then up (to whip the club head towards the target)
     + finish with the chest pointing high (above horizontal)
     + left shoulder has rotated at least 90째 from address position
     + belly button pointing to target line
   - Drill 2a [at 12m32s]:
     + fold both arms across chest
     + 10 reps - practice turns
     + focus on clearing hips and shoulders
     + full finish position
   - Drill 2b [13m53s]:
     + make half swings, pausing half way (when hands are in front of right thigh)
     + check that club is parallel to the ground
     + then finishing
     + 5-10 reps - pausing then finishing (as above)
     + 5-10 more - adding speed
   - Drill 3a [at 18m10s]:
     + Use golf bag (or similar object about hip height)
     + Hold driver upside down; hold the shaft near the head (i.e. the grip becomes the imaginary club head)
     + Get into position where you have paused half way down the downswing
       * the grip is resting on the golf bag
       * knees and hips have partly turned towards the target (i.e. you are in the "lag" position)
     + As you rotate towards the target, allow the shaft/grip to slip off of the golf bag then finish the swing fast
   - Drill 3b [at 19m36s]:
     + Hold the driver in the normal way
     + Start in the "lag" position
     + As you start the swing, feel:
       * the right heel comes off the ground while the right toes stay on the ground
       * the left toes come off the ground while the left heel stays on the ground
       * your feet spin to the left
       * legs now face the target
       * the left foot now points towards the target

   - Right knee moves back as the left knee moves forward
   - Moving the knees should allow the hips to turn about 45째 during the backswing
   - Moving hips should allow chest to open up (as if you were to grab something with right hand from a high shelf behind you)
   - Knees, hips and shoulders pivot during the swing
   - Wide (but short) backswing
   - Swing through to a full finish, i.e. chest facing the target and shaft behind the neck
   - Summary:
     + short backswing; full shoulder turn
     + full/long follow through; full shoulder turn
