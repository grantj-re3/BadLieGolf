## Long game

   - The long-arc follow through
     * The best ball strikers get the club head and their hands *as far away as possible without their head moving forward*
   - ¾ swing drill: From horizontal-to-horizontal with say 8-iron
     * Arms straight, hence elbows close together
     * Rotation: Rotate body through impact
     * Extension: Extend chest up during follow through
     * Side bend: Your trail shoulder should be lower in the follow through

   - Tip 0: Pre-game warm up
   - Tip 1: Turn more: get your right hip back
   - Tip 2: Turn even more: Allow your left heel to come off the ground during the backswing (and to stomp into the ground early during the down swing)
   - Tip 3: Slow the hands down during the down swing

   - How to shallow the angle of the club (i.e. make more horizontal) at the start of the downswing
     * Each of these *feels* promote an in-to-out swing path (i.e. baby draw)
     * [A shallow angle at impact allows a divot to be long but not deep, hence potentially more forgiving.]
   - Feel #1: Feel the right shoulder drop (i.e. move away from your right ear)
   - Feel #2: Feel that your right elbow comes down into your right pocket
   - Feel #3: Feel that you remain with your back to the target at the start of the down swing
     (i.e. while your hands start to *drop into the slot*)
