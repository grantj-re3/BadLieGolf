## Common themes

1. Grip with the fingers for flexibility (not in your palm/lifeline/fist)
1. Grip with last 3 fingers of lead hand and middle 2 fingers of trail hand
1. The "second knuckle" of the trigger (index) finger of the trail hand should
   hook around the trail side of the grip
1. Coaches/players may advocate strong or weak grip pressure, but they all
   advocate:
   * loose wrists, forearms and shoulders
   * flexibility in golf club movement (i.e. left/right and up/down)
1. Typically, thumb pressure should be light
1. For some Tour Pros (e.g. Vijay Singh and Fred Couples) the trail hand grip is so
   light at impact that the hand appears to comes off the grip shortly after impact


## Less conventional grip pressure ideas
