   - How to easily alter ball flight and spin
   - You need an ok lie for releases 2 and 3
   - Release 1 - Chip and run:
     * Uses the front section of the bounce
     * Will work from almost any lie
     * Can use almost any club, e.g. 56째 for nearby pin or 8 iron
       for distant pin
     * Just past impact, the shaft points toward your lead (left) hip
     * Use a small amount of forward shaft lean
     * Fairly level shoulders
     * Light grip
     * Lead hands in a high position (with straight wrist) which
       discourages wrist hinge [and I imagine makes the shaft steeper]
     * Chest, hands and club head are working together
     * Drill:
       + Grip the club near the ferrule
       + Allow the shaft to remain in contact with the front hip
       + Take the club back
       + Rotate forward to the finish
   - Release 2 - Soft landing shot:
     * Uses the middle section of the bounce
     * Need a reasonable lie
     * Can use your sand wedge 56째 (or 54-58째) but probably not 60째 or more
     * Just past impact, the shaft points toward your belt buckle (i.e. a little cupping in the lead wrist)
     * Ball slightly further away than release 1
     * Flare the lead foot more
     * Ball forward in your stance
     * Hands remain close to the body
     * Really light grip pressure (which allows the club to swing itself)
     * Immediately before the downswing, the toe of the club should be pointing up
     * Don't rush; let the bounce slide under the ball
     * Keep your chest moving
   - Release 3 - Lob shot:
     * Uses the trailing section of the bounce
     * Need a reasonable lie i.e. sandy lie is ok but hard-pan is not
     * Also suitable for a bunker shot
     * Just past impact, the shaft points toward your trailing (right) hip (i.e. maximum cupping in the lead wrist)
     * Wider stance
     * Ball forward
     * Shaft neutral (no forward shaft lean)
     * Longer (braver), wristier swing; arms may go horizontal during the backswing
     * More conscious release than release 2 (where gravity did the work during the downswing)
     * You must keep turning
     * Hands remain close to the body
     * At the finish, the club goes *in the holster*
