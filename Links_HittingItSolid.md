   - Arms, wrists and hands more important than big muscles in legs, shoulders, etc.
   - Avoid casting (early release). Attempt to hold the arm/shaft angle gained at top of backswing for as long as possible during the downswing
   - You can lift the heel of the lead foot during the backswing to assist with rotation of hips (by 45°) and shoulders (by 90°)
   - You can move your trailing foot back a little to also assist with rotation during the backswing
   - Drill 1:
     + Turn club upside down so you are holding the shaft (near the club head)
     + Perform a normal swing (without a ball)
     + If you are releasing properly (with lag) you should hear the whooshing sound *after* the ball position - *good*
     + If you are releasing early you should hear the whooshing sound *before* the ball position - *bad*
   - Drill 2:
     + From address, move to the top of your backswing
     + Grip lightly with fingers
     + Allow the club shaft to fall onto your shoulders; allowing the left arm to be slightly bent will help
     + Push your arms out away from your body (i.e. away from the target)
     + Then perform downswing and follow through
     + This helps you maintain a better lag angle (and therefore more power)

   - Get maximum width
     + Left arm straight
     + Rotate your hips
     + **Pull** right shoulder back (you don't need to rotate it as much)
   - Get hands and arms "deeper" in the backswing
   - Get the club pointing down the target line or laid-off
   - Don't let the arms get behind your body
   - As you turn during the backswing:
     + everything moves together; this improves your consistency
     + the club stays out in front of your chest
   - Flare both feet (particularly the right foot)
   - Drill 1:
     + Put right arm across chest
     + Left hand holding club at address position
     + Turn to where left arm is horizonal, feel it all moving together
   - Drill 2 - Belly button drill:
     + Put golf club against belly button
     + Get into golf posture / address position
     + Grip the golf club with usual grip (but on the shaft)
     + Make a backswing turn
   - Drill 3:
     + Take backswing so that arms are at about 8 o'clock (and club shaft is about vertical)
     + Focus on rotation during downswing and follow through
     + Release the club with straight arms aligning with the shaft at about 45° past impact
     + Finish with arms horizontal and club shaft vertical
     + Then repeat but now hit a ball

   - As above, but slightly different perspective
   - In addition:
     + Use the ground for power; keep the right foot down a bit longer (until after impact)
     + Use a mirror or video to check

   - Drill 1a sequencing:
     + Requires an Orange Whip swing trainer
     + Move from address to the completed backswing then stop
     + Move slowly to until the arms are at about 8 o'clock (and shaft is
       perpendicular to arms); check your position
     + Then continue with downswing and follow through (slower than normal)
       and ensure you release so that maximum speed is about 45° beyond the
       impact position
   - Drill 1b - sequencing:
     + With club in hand, move from address to the completed backswing then stop
     + While arms and hands stay in roughly this position, swivel the
       hips until they are level (and pointing to target); the shoulders will
       turn a little as a result of the hip movement; repeat this hip movement
       a few times
     + Repeat the above hip movement then continue with downswing and follow through
     + You can also do this during your game
   - Drill 2 sequencing:
     + As per drill 1a, but hold 2 irons instead of the Orange Whip swing trainer
