## Transition & shift

### Intro

1. [Keiser University College of Golf: Dr. T. J. Tomasi | The Smallest, Most Important Move in Golf | 2018-2021](https://collegeofgolf.keiseruniversity.edu/smallest-important-move-golf/)
   - The downswing’s lateral motion begins at the top of the backswing when you transfer pressure from your
     rear hip joint to your forward hip joint – meanwhile, your hips drop and slide... towards the target
   - As soon as the pressure is deposited on your lead side... the rotational motion of your hips can begin

   - The key to shifting mass is that you do it quickly, not continually
   - When to stop shifting and start rotating
