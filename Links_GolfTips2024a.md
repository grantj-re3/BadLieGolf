   - The long-arc follow through
     * The best ball strikers get the club head and their hands *as far away as possible without their head moving forward*
   - ¾ swing drill: From horizontal-to-horizontal with say 8-iron
     * Arms straight, hence elbows close together
     * Rotation: Rotate body through impact
     * Extension: Extend chest up during follow through
     * Side bend: Your trail shoulder should be lower in the follow through

   - Tip 0: Pre-game warm up
   - Tip 1: Turn more: get your right hip back
   - Tip 2: Turn even more: Allow your left heel to come off the ground during the backswing (and to stomp into the ground early during the down swing)
   - Tip 3: Slow the hands down during the down swing

   - The golf swing consists of 3 body-moves which are blended:
     * rotation
     * forward (and backward) bend
     * tilt
   - At address, we have *forward bend*
   - At the top of the backswing, we have *rotation* and *tilt*
   - Drill 1: How to find the correct body position at the top of the backswing:
     * Take your address position
     * Stand up straight (bend elbows so your forearms are horizontal; hold club vertically with club head at the top)
     * Rotate so your shoulders to 90° (with left shoulder forward)
     * Tilt from the hips so that your left shoulder moves towards the ball; [as you do this:
       + Your left knee will bend more
       + Your right leg will extend so it is almost straight]
   - Drill 2: Hip movement during the backswing
     * Stand near a wall with your left foot against the wall and shoulders/hips 90° to the wall
     * Put a ~6" (~15cm) diameter ball between your left hip and the wall; your hip position should hold it in place
     * Put an alignment stick (or club) across your shoulders
     * Take a backswing from the address position while ensuring that your hip continues to hold the ball in place
   - Important: After improving the student's swing, it was necessary to make a corresponding change to the ball position at address

   - Although I think they mean the same thing, his definition of fast/slow hands appears to be the opposite of Matt Lockey above
   - Slow hands (bad)
     * During the downswing, we *pull* (down) with the *back of the lead hand*
     * A chopping action
     * Slows the club head down
     * Leaves the club face open
     * At impact, the hands are behind the body
     * Not much *release*
   - Fast hands (good)
     * Produce more club head speed and squares the club face much better (hence longer straighter golf shots)
     * Let the dominant (right) hand hit the ball
     * Let the dominant (right) hand square up the club face
     * The hands *release* as the club face approaches impact
     * We *do not flip* (i.e. allow the club head to get ahead of the hands) because we blend this movement with body rotation
     * This release sends the ball further with less effort
     * Drill 1: Practice hitting a ball with feet together so the body is not too involved
     * Drill 2: Hit an imaginary flower head by:
       + Holding the shaft one handed with the dominant (right) hand near the club head
       + Pretend to hit an object in front of you (e.g. a flower head) with the handle by *releasing* the club (stick)
       + Swing roughly horizontally

   - How to shallow the angle of the club (i.e. make more horizontal) at the start of the downswing
     * Each of these *feels* promote an in-to-out swing path (i.e. baby draw)
     * [A shallow angle at impact allows a divot to be long but not deep, hence potentially more forgiving.]
   - Feel #1: Feel the right shoulder drop (i.e. move away from your right ear)
   - Feel #2: Feel that your right elbow comes down into your right pocket
   - Feel #3: Feel that you remain with your back to the target at the start of the down swing
     (i.e. while your hands start to *drop into the slot*)
