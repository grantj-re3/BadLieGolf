# My greenside bunker shots

What works for me (in Jan 2024)...

## Soft fluffy sand

- Open the club face (but for me, only to about 1 o'clock)
- Ball forward in stance (but for me, only slightly forward of center)
- **Closed stance**
- Weight on front foot and keep it there (i.e. do not sway back during
  the backswing and forward during the downswing)
- No forward shaft lean (i.e. **sternum, top of handle and bottom of shaft are all in a line**)
- **Right hand grip is very very weak** (i.e. I can see all knuckles and the "V" between my
  thumb and index finger points between my neck and *left* shoulder)
- **Address the ball with the club head hovering above the sand a few inches
  behind the intended entry point into the sand**
- **Take a good length, wristy backswing / wristy follow through**
- **Generate a lot of club head speed at impact with the sand**
- Make first contact with the sand about 2" behind the ball
- **I try to keep the legs and head very quiet/still during the backswing
  and downswing**
- **Rotate your body and finish facing the target**
