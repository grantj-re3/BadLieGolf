   - [2m42s - 4m10s] General ideas to drive longer:  Wide stance
     | Hit up on the ball (which launches higher and spins lower)
     | Tee inside your left heel, i.e. off the front foot (which helps you hit up)
     | Tilt upper body away from target (which helps you hit up)
     | [Tee the ball higher since your club head is going to reach it's lowest point then strike the ball on the way up]
     | Take club away faster on the backswing
   - [6m62s - 23m50s] From individual coaching: | On the way down, feel like you are hitting the ball with your right pocket
     | More hip-turn during take back (i.e. wind up) | More shoulder-turn during take back (i.e. wind up) | More looseness in the swing
