# Greenside bunker shots

1. [AlexElliottGolf | THE ONLY SUPER SIMPLE BUNKER SHOT LESSON YOU NEED! (video) | 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlRxGDd-lNQ) Setup: 0m40s-1m57s
   - [Stance wider than shoulder width]
   - The ball is a club-head-width inside your left/lead heel
   - Flare the feet
   - Dig the feet into the sand
   - Hold the club in the air, open the face slightly then regrip
   - Bend your knees so your hips and upper body move down (towards the sand)
     * Weight mostly on your left/lead leg
     * The resulting lie-angle will cause the club face to point further left
       (hence compensating for the slightly open/right-facing club face)

1. [ChrisRyanGolf | The EASIEST Way To Get Out ANY Bunker! (ITS NOT HARD) (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFkVfKZ2Sfw) For level 2 (high shot):
   - Wide stance
   - Ball forward of center
   - Weight more on the lead/right leg
   - Swing thought: Move sand from bunker onto the green
   - Hips lower so that the hands/handle is lower (has side-effect of pointing face left).
     This makes the swing arc flatter.
   - Open club face (i.e. point the face right)
   - Bend wrists at take away (L-shape angle between forearms and shaft)
   - Big release of the wrists through the impact zone
   - Don't rotate forearm because that would point the club "down" (close the face)

1. [MrShortGame Golf | THE 5 BIGGEST MISTAKES GOLFERS MAKE WHEN IN A BUNKER (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnAYI7Ra7Zg)
   - Club selection:
     * How far do you need to hit to the hole? Consider taking a longer club (e.g. gap wedge)
       and open the face.
     * What type of sand? Fluffy sand requires more bounce / hard packed sand requires less bounce
     * [How much height do you need to hit over the lip?]
   - Keep hands low throughout the swing (so that you don't allow the swing to be too steep)
   - Use a longer swing (i.e. hands to the shoulder on the backswing)
   - Accelerate when hands are at your thighs through to [and past] impact
   - Wide stance and bend your knees (and weight on left/lead leg)

1. [MrShortGame Golf | 3 Golf Bunker Myths you MUST KNOW ABOUT! (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPnUA3htUDA)
   - Club selection as above
   - Instead of thinking "hit 2 inches behind the ball" think that you need to "slice the
     legs off from under the ball" (so that you don't hit too far behind the ball)
   - You don't need to open the club face a lot for every bunker shot. Opening the face a
     little is sometimes adequate.

   - Club face naturally opens during backswing...
   - Don't allow the club to close through the impact zone.
   - Hit sand 2 inches behind the ball.
   - One arm drills.

   - Step #1: Assess where you contact the sand:
     * Draw tramlines (2 club-head widths apart)
     * Lines are at right angles to the target line
     * Imaginary ball in the middle of tramlines
     * Are you striking the sand in the center of the tramlines?
   - Step #2: Assess depth control (how much sand you take):
     * Tramlines as per first 3 points above
     * Are you taking a small amount of sand (length of $5 note)?
   - Drill to get feedback:
     * Left/lead foot in the middle of tramlines
     * Right foot well back, behind the left foot
     * Almost all your weight is over the lead foot
     * Feel the right balance as you take your normal bunker swing
       (including hitting through the sand)
     * Hold your finish position with your body facing the target
   - Distance control:
     * After perfecting the above...
     * Short: hands move from hip height on backswing to hip height on follow through
     * Long: hands move from chest height on backswing to chest height on follow through
     * Long: consider using a 50° or 60° wedge
   - For firm sand:
     * Use chopping motion into the sand
     * Throw the heel of the club firmly into the sand (not using the bounce of the club)

   - Info below is for a 15-20 yard bunker shot
   - Ball off the front foot
   - Most of your weight over the front foot
   - Open stance
   - Flare out the front foot
   - Virtually a full swing, ~70mph club head speed (not a weak 35mph)
   - Face open by ~30 degrees
   - Hit the sand 6-7" behind ball (not 2" as commonly recommended)

1. [Top Speed Golf - Clay Ballard | Best Bunker Tips | How to Play Bunkers - Hard or Soft Sand (video) | 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVqWoduC-tk)
   - 0m32s: Soft sand (15m / 50 foot shot):
     * Face open, ~45°
     * Wide stance (dig your shoes into the sand)
     * Ball forward in stance
     * Weight on front foot
     * Swing vertical / thump the sand
     * Hit the sand 4-6" behind ball
     * Big/full swing [with follow through and body facing target]
   - 5m05s: Hard/wet sand (15m / 50 foot shot):
     * Face less open, ~30°
     * Hit the sand closer to the ball; 2-4" behind ball
     * Hit down to penetrate the wet, hard sand
     * Swing ultra-aggressive (even more aggressive than soft sand because you are trying to **penetrate** the **hard sand**) / thump the sand
     * Other aspects as for soft sand [including big/full swing with follow through and body facing target]

## Summary

- We must "engage the bounce" of the sand wedge, hence:
  * ball forward in stance
  * weight on front foot
  * shaft must be vertical at address (or even slightly tilted away from the target) when viewed from the front
  * open the club face
  * do not release wrists much at impact or follow through (i.e. keep the club face open)
- Since we are going to hit the sand and not the ball, this requires a lot of energy, hence:
  * take a good length backswing
  * thump the sand
  * make first contact with the sand about 2" behind the ball
  * take a shallow divit (about 1" deep)
  * continue with the follow through
  * rotate your body and finish facing the target
- So we have plenty of loft to get the ball out of the bunker:
  * use a wide stance which brings the body and hands low
  * make a steep the backswing by:
    + breaking the wrists (so the arms and shaft form an "L" shape
    + take the club up (not back behind your body)
- Also:
  * dig/grind your feet into the sand (for stability)
  * grip down the shaft for more control (and to compensate for
    'low hands' due to digging feet into sand and wide stance)
  * flare the front foot (to promote a follow through)
- My tip:
  * after observing the lie of the ball in the bunker, consider doing
    your practice swing *outside* the bunker to check where you first
    make contact with the ground

   - Drill 2 (sand required, but no bunker needed):
     * As for drill 1, but:
       + place a ball on the pile of sand
       + swing as before
     * [You may require a net or limited flight (foam or hollow) practice ball if you are doing this at home]
   - Drill 3 (bunker *is* required):
     * As for drill 2, but
       + make a small pile of sand *in the bunker* 
       + place a ball on the pile of sand
