   - Setting the club face open
   - Aligning too far open
   - Ball position and weight [IMPORTANT]
   - Length of backswing [check point: shaft points behind the back foot at the top of the backswing]
   - Poor concept of impact [concept: club head travels *forwards* through the sand to carry the parcel
     of sand onto the green; not the concept of hitting down into the sand]

   - Speed
     * Arm swing
     * Shoulder to shoulder swing
     * Plenty of body rotation
   - Open the club face and maintain loft during the swing
   - At the end of the swing, club face should point towards your own face
   - For a longer shot, use a longer wedge
   - Aim for the fat part of the green when necessary
   - Check what sort of sand you are playing from
   - Exaggerate the body rotation

   - Hard sand [I like this technique]
     * Strike the sand with the tow of the club face (hence less resistance by the sand)
     * Upright shaft (handle is high) and steep swing plane
     * Right shoulder is high at address
     * [Narrower/taller stance]
   - Soft sand
     * Strike the sand with the middle of the club face (i.e. middle of the bounce)
     * Lower shaft (handle is low) and shallow swing plane (around the body)
     * Left shoulder is high at address
     * Wider stance

   - Problem: Weight too far back.
     * Fix: Put weight on the left heel (instead of left toes) to encourage left hip to open during the follow through.
   - Problem: Too much forward shaft lean at impact.
     * Fix: Take a longer backswing, then wait so that the club head starts the downswing.
     * Fix: Let the club head pass your hands at impact.
   - Problem: Ball too far back.
     * Fix: Place the ball just inside the left heel which will be the center/bottom of the swing arc (when most of your weight is over the left leg).
