# The Golf Kinematic Sequence

## Introduction

1. [Titleist Performance Institute: Phil Cheetham | The Linear Kinematic Sequence](https://www.mytpi.com/articles/biomechanics/the-linear-kinematic-sequence)
   - It is known that there is an efficient sequence of motion in a skilled
     golf swing called the Kinematic Sequence. It describes the ...
     sequencing of the rotation speeds of the body segments.
   - Each body segment; pelvis, ribcage and arm sequentially accelerates and
     decelerates before impact, starting from the inner large body segments;
     the pelvis and ribcage, then progressing to the smaller outer segments;
     the arms, hands and club.
   - Each successive segment peaks faster and later than the previous segment.
   - This action causes the club to accelerate rapidly and reach its highest
     speed at impact.

1. My thoughts
   - Kinematic Sequence results in a *throwing* or *slinging* action which
     we need to achieve a high club head speed at impact
   - Although there are many differences, there are also several similarities
     to the *trebuchet*. The trebuchet has:
     * a stable base (where the machine is in contact with the ground)
     * a relatively slow movement of heavy components near the base
     * a relatively fast movement of lighter components far from the base
     * a two lever system where:
       + the *joint* between the two levers is free to throw or sling the projectile
       + the second (faster) lever's rotation lags behind that of the first until
         near the point of release
