   - How to easily alter ball flight and spin
   - You need an ok lie for releases 2 and 3
   - Release 1 - Chip and run:
     * Uses the front section of the bounce
     * Will work from almost any lie
     * Can use almost any club, e.g. 56° for nearby pin or 8 iron
       for distant pin
     * Just past impact, the shaft points toward your lead (left) hip
     * Use a small amount of forward shaft lean
     * Fairly level shoulders
     * Light grip
     * Lead hands in a high position (with straight wrist) which
       discourages wrist hinge [and I imagine makes the shaft steeper]
     * Chest, hands and club head are working together
     * Drill:
       + Grip the club near the ferrule
       + Allow the shaft to remain in contact with the front hip
       + Take the club back
       + Rotate forward to the finish
   - Release 2 - Soft landing shot:
     * Uses the middle section of the bounce
     * Need a reasonable lie
     * Can use your sand wedge 56° (or 54-58°) but probably not 60° or more
     * Just past impact, the shaft points toward your belt buckle (i.e. a little cupping in the lead wrist)
     * Ball slightly further away than release 1
     * Flare the lead foot more
     * Ball forward in your stance
     * Hands remain close to the body
     * Really light grip pressure (which allows the club to swing itself)
     * Immediately before the downswing, the toe of the club should be pointing up
     * Don't rush; let the bounce slide under the ball
     * Keep your chest moving
   - Release 3 - Lob shot:
     * Uses the trailing section of the bounce
     * Need a reasonable lie i.e. sandy lie is ok but hard-pan is not
     * Also suitable for a bunker shot
     * Just past impact, the shaft points toward your trailing (right) hip (i.e. maximum cupping in the lead wrist)
     * Wider stance
     * Ball forward
     * Shaft neutral (no forward shaft lean)
     * Longer (braver), wristier swing; arms may go horizontal during the backswing
     * More conscious release than release 2 (where gravity did the work during the downswing)
     * You must keep turning
     * Hands remain close to the body
     * At the finish, the club goes *in the holster*

   [3m43s]
   - [6m30s] Release 1 - Chip and run (low trajectory)
     * 3/10 grip pressure (very loose)
     * Level shoulders (not right shoulder down)
     * Pivot around *stacked* left side
     * Left foot flared
     * Wide, connected takeaway
     * Use the front of the bounce
     * Sternum just in front of the ball
     * Release 1: Shaft handle points to the left hip shortly after impact
       *and* club head stops lower than the hands
     * Hips must rotate during backswing and follow through
     * Rehearse the arc in the swing without a club (not a linear swing)
     * Drill: Grip the club near the ferrule... (see notes re earlier video)
     * Slow transition
     * This technique exposes the bounce more, hence is more forgiving
       (i.e. gives a reasonable result if you to hit it a little heavy/fat)
   - [23m55s] Release 2 - Soft landing shot (mid trajectory)
     * Aside: 60° wedge is for *emergency use only*
     * Grip pressure, shoulders, pivot and flared left foot all as per release 1
     * Use the middle of the bounce
     * Hit the ground behind the ball!!!
     * Sternum just in front of the ball
     * Release 2: Shaft handle points to the belt buckle shortly after impact
     * Aim to hit the ground 1 inch before the ball; hitting 3 inches before 
       the ball is probably ok (but hitting thin is not)
     * Hands lower than release 1 at address
     * Let the hands *fall* at transition
     * Hands finish close to the left hip
     * Drill:
       + Feel the club head fall by swinging with thumbs off the handle
       + Just before impact, support the swing by rotating the chest
     * Let the left upper arm almost stall just after impact (while
       the lower arm releases)
     * Drill to feel release 2:
       + While swinging the club with the left arm, hold the left upper
         arm against the chest (with the right hand)
       + Feel the left lower arm release
       + Feel the left upper arm being connected to the chest
   - [48m04s] Bunker
     * Pads of the hands come off the grip before putting the club
       in the holster
     * Feel the right arm move across your stomach after impact
