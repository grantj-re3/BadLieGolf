# Greenside bunker shots

1. [AlexElliottGolf | THE ONLY SUPER SIMPLE BUNKER SHOT LESSON YOU NEED! (video) | 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlRxGDd-lNQ) Setup: 0m40s-1m57s
   - [Stance wider than shoulder width]
   - The ball is a club-head-width inside your left/lead heel
   - Flare the feet
   - Dig the feet into the sand
   - Hold the club in the air, open the face slightly then regrip
   - Bend your knees so your hips and upper body move down (towards the sand)
     * Weight mostly on your left/lead leg
     * The resulting lie-angle will cause the club face to point further left
       (hence compensating for the slightly open/right-facing club face)

1. [ChrisRyanGolf | The EASIEST Way To Get Out ANY Bunker! (ITS NOT HARD) (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFkVfKZ2Sfw) For level 2 (high shot):
   - Wide stance
   - Ball forward of center
   - Weight more on the lead/right leg
   - Swing thought: Move sand from bunker onto the green
   - Hips lower so that the hands/handle is lower (has side-effect of pointing face left).
     This makes the swing arc flatter.
   - Open club face (i.e. point the face right)
   - Bend wrists at take away (L-shape angle between forearms and shaft)
   - Big release of the wrists through the impact zone
   - Don't rotate forearm because that would point the club "down" (close the face)

   - Club selection:
     * How far do you need to hit to the hole? Consider taking a longer club (e.g. gap wedge)
       and open the face.
     * What type of sand? Fluffy sand requires more bounce / hard packed sand requires less bounce
     * [How much height do you need to hit over the lip?]
   - Keep hands low throughout the swing (so that you don't allow the swing to be too steep)
   - Use a longer swing (i.e. hands to the shoulder on the backswing)
   - Accelerate when hands are at your thighs through to [and past] impact
   - Wide stance and bend your knees (and weight on left/lead leg)

   - Club selection as above
   - Instead of thinking "hit 2 inches behind the ball" think that you need to "slice the
     legs off from under the ball" (so that you don't hit too far behind the ball)
   - You don't need to open the club face a lot for every bunker shot. Opening the face a
     little is sometimes adequate.

   - Club face naturally opens during backswing...
   - Don't allow the club to close through the impact zone.
   - Hit sand 2 inches behind the ball.
   - One arm drills.

   - Step #1: Assess where you contact the sand:
     * Draw tramlines (2 club-head widths apart)
     * Lines are at right angles to the target line
     * Imaginary ball in the middle of tramlines
     * Are you striking the sand in the center of the tramlines?
   - Step #2: Assess depth control (how much sand you take):
     * Tramlines as per first 3 points above
     * Are you taking a small amount of sand (length of $5 note)?
   - Drill to get feedback:
     * Left/lead foot in the middle of tramlines
     * Right foot well back, behind the left foot
     * Almost all your weight is over the lead foot
     * Feel the right balance as you take your normal bunker swing
       (including hitting through the sand)
     * Hold your finish position with your body facing the target
   - Distance control:
     * After perfecting the above...
     * Short: hands move from hip height on backswing to hip height on follow through
     * Long: hands move from chest height on backswing to chest height on follow through
     * Long: consider using a 50° or 60° wedge
   - For firm sand:
     * Use chopping motion into the sand
     * Throw the heel of the club firmly into the sand (not using the bounce of the club)

   - Ball off the front foot
   - Most of your weight over the front foot
   - Open stance
   - Flare out the front foot

   - Face open by ~30 degrees
   - Hit the sand 6-7" behind ball (not 2" as commonly recommended)
