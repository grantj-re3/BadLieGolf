     * GIOTF: Get it on the fairway
     * GIOTG: Get it on the green
   - I like his sense of humour [here](https://www.golfsidekick.com/about)
     + He did not pursue professional golf for numerous reasons but the main one being that if you win
       the Masters, you have to pay for the Champions dinner the next year out your own pocket. No thank you.

   - Information is based on Shot Scope user data collected during competition
   - 80% of missed greens are short
     * Improve your ball striking
     * Consider more forgiving equipment
     * Know your carry (and total) distances for each club
   - Which club should you use off the tee?
     * Typically driver goes 30m further than 3-wood
     * Typically 3-wood is only 1% more accurate
     * If you need to hit a more accurate club, ensure the one you select *is* more accurate
   - How aggressive is your strategy when playing into greens?
     * Typically the fastest way to improve is to make fewer double bogeys (not to make more birdies)
     * Consider playing approach shots to the middle of the green
   - 82% of putts beyond 5 feet are short
     * Aim to leave putts 18" past the hole
   - Often said that you should leave yourself a little further back so you can hit a full pitch shot into the green.
     However the data does not support this; players hit the ball closer to the hole when they are closer to the green.
   - Hybrids vs long irons?
     * For 13 handicap and above, hybrids are typically better
   - Are you more likely to miss right or left off the tee?
     * Know which category you are in
     * Manage your misses; e.g. consider taking a less aggressive club
       if you typically miss right but there is water on the right

   - Process: Golfing goal > optimise strategy > optimise course management = lower scores
   - Optimising your scoring is not about how good your good shots are, but rather, how good your bad shots are and how many strokes those bad shots cost you
   - You are far better off picking easy shots and making confident swings, than you are picking challenging golf shots that are outside your comfort zone.
   - I assume you have a golfing goal in your head – write it down. Next, work out ways you can achieve this outcome.
   - Now you have a strategy, let’s apply it to your course management.
     * Course management – work backwards on each hole
     * Course management – off the tee
       + Consider favouring the one side of the fairway that gives you a little extra room for error
       + Finalise your target off the tee
       + Make the best possible swing you can towards this target
       + [This article shows an **excellent *Playing Stats* sheet**]
     * Course management – into the green
       + Frequently aim away from flags and towards the centre of the green
       + Distance control really does matter.
       + A rangefinder is far more valuable than rough estimates to the front and back of the green.
       + Work out your golf club distances every 6-months or so.
       + Except for dangerous pin positions, always aim to be pin high.
       + For amateurs, ~80% of mid-iron shots finish short of target.
         Consider hitting an extra club for every approach shot to see
         what happens to your greens in regulation and scoring.
     * Course management – around the greens
       + If you have a simple chip inside 20-yards aim to hole it.
       + See links to chipping guide and chipping games.
       + Practice with 8-iron, sand wedge and putter. On the course, choose the option you feel most confident with.
     * Summary:
       + Be clear with your strategy, break down each hole and work backwards to come up with the best plan you can.
       + This approach doesn’t guarantee success, but it maximises your chances.

     * The 70% rule: Play a club/shot where you can get the result you want 7 times out of 10
       (in other words, a reliable shot)
     * Select a club which you are more confident and more capable with
     * Advantage: Results in more pars and bogeys (i.e. keeps big scores off the card)
     * Disadvantage: Will often result in less birdies

   - Lee Westwood: “Know your average yardages”
     * Choose your club based on your average carry distance and favour the longer club if you’re in doubt – unless there’s serious trouble just over the green.
   - Soren Kjeldsen: “Leave yourself below the hole”
   - Ryan Fox: “Choose the best lay-up
     * If it’s at the back and you have a lot of green to work with, the closer you can get to the green the better.
     * If it’s at the front, consider leaving yourself a full shot so you can stop the ball with height and spin.
   - Francesco Molinari: “Play for the middle of the green”
   - Chris Paisley: “...keep the ball in play!”
     * You can save yourself a lot of strokes by getting the ball in play with a 3-wood, especially if driver brings
       hazards more into play or you can’t reach a par 5 in two
   - Colin Montgomerie: “Take your punishment and don’t make it worse”
     * you don’t want turn a bogey into a double or triple
   - Peter Hanson: “Aim on the safe side”
     * Do this even if you’re feeling comfortable and you have a relatively short club in your hand
     * Aim three or four yards to the safe side of the pin if it’s near the edge of the green
   - Marcel Siem: “Check the pin position”
     * Walk to a position where you can see the green and flag if the shot is blind
     * Pin position and hazards will determine where you can’t miss the green and what miss will leave a simple up-and-down
   - Joost Luiten: “Play the percentages...”
     * I’d rather have 130 from the fairway than 100 yards out of the rough

     * If you don't like talking in a video, then this one is not for you.
     * I don't know a thing about swing mechanics and I am not the best at
       course management, but I am good enough to play off a single figure
       handicap and have some fun when I hit the links. 
     * My ideas and plans are not always right, and I don't always pull off
       what I say but having a plan is better than having no plan.
     * Accepting yourself and the things you are good at, planning for the
       best miss and leaving yourself the easiest most comfy shots is just
       a simple and fun way to be in control of your game and emotions.

     * Take the pressure off by making your own score card where you:
       + For stroke index 1-9: add 2 strokes to par to give *your* par
       + For stroke index 10-18: add 1 stroke to par to give *your* par
     * Take the pressure off by not accumulating your score until you
       have finished playing your round
   - [Golf Sidekick - Matt Greene | How to Break 90 or 100 Guaranteed - ESSENTIAL INFO for maximum potential (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWauCDF5V1I)
     * Know the (approximate) trajectory of your clubs
     * Know how to play a punch shot
     * Have **one** go-to chipping club
     * For high handicappers, don't bother with gapping (e.g. 10-15 yards between each club). It is
       okay to have a few clubs where you know their distances.
     * You must be good at 120 yards or less. (E.g. You must be able to hit a ball from 120 yards onto
       or near the green.) This includes putting, chipping/pitching and bunker shots.
     * Know your game.
       + Know which shots you hit well/poorly.
       + Know which clubs you hit well/poorly.
       + It is okay to hit a big fade with a driver if it is *reliable*.
     * Don't count your (accumulating) score as you go. Don't count your score after nine holes.
     * Don't take "clueless" swing-mechanics to the golf course. [I suspect he is saying not to try
       new swings, tricks, etc. while playing your round of golf.]
     * Know how to sink 3-foot putts. *Practice putts from 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 feet.*
     * Get good at eliminating double, triple, quadruple bogeys

     * Tips about club selection, direction of shot, loft of shot
     * Pick a shot so that your next/approach shot is with your favourite club
   - The introductory text says:
     1. Dont add up your score as you go, just count the strokes put it in the card, add it all up after 18 holes.
     2. Hit the safest club off the tee to keep you in play.
     3. Add 2 stokes to the par of each hole with index 1 to 9. Add 1 stroke to the par of each hole index 10-18.
     4. Your new Green in regulation changes unlike a pro green in regulation.
     5. Take into account the roll out of your chips. Do not land the ball AT THE HOLE. It will roll out so plan for that and chip short to run up.
     6. Practice your putting - you can probably cut 6 strokes alone from NOT three putting. You don't three putt if you practice diligently.
     7. Stop getting angry because you dont play like a pro. This is a delusion. If you advance the ball toward the hole, it is a positive.

## How to break 80

1. [The Left Rough | The Amateur's Guide to Breaking 80 on a Consistent Basis | c.2021](https://theleftrough.com/breaking-80/) - **I love this article**
   - It's important to have the right mindset and understand that you can shoot 79 a ton of different ways
   - I’ve personally had rounds where I couldn’t find the clubface and broke 80 because of an awesome short game
   - Breaking 80 comes down to your long game, your short game, your course strategy, and your mental game
   - Basic Shots for Your Long Game
     * Off the tee:
       + If you can hit over 235 off the tee and have some short game, you can break 80
       + Most golfers who break 80 have a consistent shot off the tee; usually they have go-to shot
     * Irons:
       + Even the best players in the world only hit 60-70% of greens
       + Instead of mindlessly hitting 7-irons on the range, use that time for short game
   - Basic Shots for Your Short Game
     * spend a majority of your practice time working on shots 125 yards and closer
       + even if you are hitting fairways and greens, a bad short game can ruin your round
     * Become a Wedge Wizard
       + Understand how far you hit each wedge
       + Try to have a full distance and a ¾ distance shots
     * Master the Bunker Shot
     * Bump n Run
       + A bump and run shot is much more reliable than a flop shot
     * High Pitch Shot
       + Work on hitting high soft shots from 30 yards and in
     * Putting
       + Nearly 40% of all of your shots come from the fringe and green
       + Studies have found its most effective to practice from 4-15 feet (1-4 metres) and 25 plus feet (8+ metres)
   - Course Strategy to Break 80
     * Pre-Round Warm-Up
       + 20-30 minutes; 15 on the range and 15 on chipping and putting
       + The pre-round warm-up is *not* a time to change your swing or use any new tricks
     * Tee Box Strategy
       + Have a strategy for the best way to play each hole
       + Figure out where is the best spot to hit and where should you avoid
     * Approach Shot Strategy
       + 90% of the time go for the fattest part of the green
       + If you have a wedge or short iron, go more towards the flag
     * Strategy for Playing a New Golf Course
       + Use Google Maps or study the GPS before you head to a new course
   - Mental Hacks to Break 80
     * Quit Thinking About Breaking 80
       + If you walk on the first tee and your goal is to break 80 or shoot your best
         score ever, you’ve already lost (this will add pressure, tension, and nerves)
       + Instead, go to the first tee and *focus on creating a strategy to best play the hole*
     * Play One Shot at a Time
       + If you let your mind wander into the future, you will lose focus
       + Instead, think about the current shot you face
     * Master Your Emotions & Self-Talk
       + Manage your emotions
       + Be positive
       + Choose to be optimistic regardless of what is happening
       + Think about how to self-correct those bad shots/putts
   - Final Thoughts
     * Focus on a small set of shots that you use the most each round
     * Consider what held you back from breaking 80. My guess is that it was:
       + a faulty short game
       + getting too aggressive off the tee, or
       + a negative mindset
