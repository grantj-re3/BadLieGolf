     * Driving distance is proportional to club head speed. In other words, if you want to drive
       the ball longer, you need to increase your club head speed (all other things being equal).
     * On average, golfers with a lower handicap have a higher driver club head speed

1. [18STRONG: Jeff Pelizzaro | The Simplest SWING SPEED Training Drill for Golf... Ever! (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIShQNV2kFA)
   - Training: 3 sets | 10 swings (max speed) | 2-3 minute rest between sets | Podcast below says: 2-3 times per week
   - Caution: Warm up first | Take the rest breaks | Combine with strength training
   - [337: Swing Speed Training Q&A with Chris Finn (podcast) | 2022](https://18strong.com/337-swing-speed-training-chris-finn/)
     * [37m10s] Above training (3x 10 swings) 2-3 times per week
     * [47m38s] The only things that matter golf-mobility wise are: Hip internal rotation (i.e. rotating into your trail leg and
       rotating into your lead side) | Shoulder external rotation | Thoracic [spine] rotation | Neck rotation
     * [1h01m32s] Strength training for speed and power: Can rotate into your hip, shoulders, spine and neck | Can produce lower body
       vertical-power (e.g. squatting, lunging) | Can produce upper body push-power (e.g. chest pressing, bench pressing, cable pressing, med ball)

1. [GOLFTEC: Hannah Gregg & Fredrik Lindblom | Offseason Swing Speed Training for Golf (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgrkRrvGf7g)
   - Practice sequence to increase swing speed: Rip the club back | Lift your lead foot heel | Plant your lead foot heel as you push into the ground
   - Deeper/bigger backswing while maintaining the weight on the inside of your trail foot
   - Focus on speed and mechanics, not on direction and contact

1. [Mike Carroll | Club Head Speed - Individualisation & Overcoming Plateaus | 2022](https://fitforgolf.blog/club-head-speed-training/)
   - This article is mostly about principles rather than technical details.
   - Speed training criteria: Have the intent to swing very very fast | Have a device for speed feedback | Insert breaks during sessions
   - For example, 10 swings at maximum speed 2 times a week might be enough of a stimulus for a beginner to see improvements in speed...
     someone 6 months into speed training may need 30-50 swings at maximum speed two or three times a week to see improvement.
   - It is a good idea to start on the conservative side in terms of weekly volume. I recommend doing as little as required while still
     seeing progress. This volume can then be gradually increased over time as necessary.
