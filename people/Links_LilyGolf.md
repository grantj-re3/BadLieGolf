   - For driver, woods & irons: At the start of the downswing, bring the club down with your arms while
     keeping your right shoulder back (i.e. minimal shoulder turn)
   - Drill/feel: Take your backswing | Remove your left hand from the club and place it on your right shoulder |
     Use only your right arm to swing (into an impact bag) while keeping your right shoulder back |
     Do this without any tension in your shoulders

   - Controlling the putting distance: Find your swing size | Find your tempo
   - Find your swing size: Method 1 - See how far the ball goes with *1 or 3 clubhead backswing* |
     Method 2 - See how far the ball goes with a backswing to the *inside of your right foot*
