## Transition & shift

### Intro

   - The downswing’s lateral motion begins at the top of the backswing when you transfer pressure from your
     rear hip joint to your forward hip joint – meanwhile, your hips drop and slide... towards the target
   - As soon as the pressure is deposited on your lead side... the rotational motion of your hips can begin
