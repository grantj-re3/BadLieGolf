# Greenside bunker shots

1. [Golf Sidekick - Matt | How to Play out of Every Type of Bunker the Golf Sidekick Way | 2018](https://www.golfsidekick.com/knowledge/how-to-play-bunker-shots/)
   - Open stance
   - Open club face
   - No forward shaft lean
   - Loosen up them wrists!
     * Hinge those wrists
     * No stiff wrists
   - Enter the sand one inch behind the ball and follow through
     * One inch
     * Accelerate / release
     * Follow through
   - Practice...
     * [Lose your fear]
     * Get down to a green side bunker facility and **draw a line behind the ball where you want to enter the sand**.
     * Remember to hinge your wrists on the way back and again on the way down after follow through.
     * Slap that sand with the sole of the club using your right hand and finish your swing.
   - Avoid:
     * Stiff wrists
     * Using a chipping technique
     * Hitting down into the sand with the leading edge 
     * No follow through on the shot
     * Entering the sand too far behind the ball
     * Trying to clip the ball off the sand
     * Simply never practicing bunker shots at all

1. [AlexElliottGolf | THE ONLY SUPER SIMPLE BUNKER SHOT LESSON YOU NEED! (video) | 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlRxGDd-lNQ) Setup: 0m40s-1m57s
   - [Stance wider than shoulder width]
   - The ball is a club-head-width inside your left/lead heel
   - Flare the feet
   - Dig the feet into the sand
   - Hold the club in the air, open the face slightly then regrip
   - Bend your knees so your hips and upper body move down (towards the sand)
     * Weight mostly on your left/lead leg
     * The resulting lie-angle will cause the club face to point further left
       (hence compensating for the slightly open/right-facing club face)

1. [ChrisRyanGolf | The EASIEST Way To Get Out ANY Bunker! (ITS NOT HARD) (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFkVfKZ2Sfw) For level 2 (high shot):
   - Wide stance
   - Ball forward of center
   - Weight more on the lead/right leg
   - Swing thought: Move sand from bunker onto the green
   - Hips lower so that the hands/handle is lower (has side-effect of pointing face left).
     This makes the swing arc flatter.
   - Open club face (i.e. point the face right)
   - Bend wrists at take away (L-shape angle between forearms and shaft)
   - Big release of the wrists through the impact zone
   - Don't rotate forearm because that would point the club "down" (close the face)

1. [MrShortGame Golf | THE 5 BIGGEST MISTAKES GOLFERS MAKE WHEN IN A BUNKER (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnAYI7Ra7Zg)
   - Club selection:
     * How far do you need to hit to the hole? Consider taking a longer club (e.g. gap wedge)
       and open the face.
     * What type of sand? Fluffy sand requires more bounce / hard packed sand requires less bounce
     * [How much height do you need to hit over the lip?]
   - Keep hands low throughout the swing (so that you don't allow the swing to be too steep)
   - Use a longer swing (i.e. hands to the shoulder on the backswing)
   - Accelerate when hands are at your thighs through to [and past] impact
   - Wide stance and bend your knees (and weight on left/lead leg)

1. [MrShortGame Golf | 3 Golf Bunker Myths you MUST KNOW ABOUT! (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPnUA3htUDA)
   - Club selection as above
   - Instead of thinking "hit 2 inches behind the ball" think that you need to "slice the
     legs off from under the ball" (so that you don't hit too far behind the ball)
   - You don't need to open the club face a lot for every bunker shot. Opening the face a
     little is sometimes adequate.

1. [Danny Maude | Possibly the BEST Bunker Tip EVER! - How to play bunker shots from Hard or Soft Sand (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHlr_KyG26A)
   - General bunker feeling
     * Club face naturally opens during backswing...
     * Don't allow the club to close through the impact zone.
     * Hit sand 2 inches behind the ball.
     * One arm drills.
   - 6m30s: **Firm/compacted/wet sand**
     * During setup, move your upper body so that more weight is on the lead (left) foot;
       this means the bottom of the swing arc will be a a couple of inches closer to the
       target (left)
     * This means the club will dig into the sand (and not bounce off the hard sand); i.e.
       the club head will enter the sand a little steeper than for the normal sand shot

1. [Danny Maude | EASIEST way to get out of ANY Bunker - NEW DISCOVERY! (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXnusNYElco)
   - Step #1: Assess where you contact the sand:
     * Draw tramlines (2 club-head widths apart)
     * Lines are at right angles to the target line
     * Imaginary ball in the middle of tramlines
     * Are you striking the sand in the center of the tramlines?
   - Step #2: Assess depth control (how much sand you take):
     * Tramlines as per first 3 points above
     * Are you taking a small amount of sand (length of $5 note)?
   - Drill to get feedback:
     * Left/lead foot in the middle of tramlines
     * Right foot well back, behind the left foot
     * Almost all your weight is over the lead foot
     * Feel the right balance as you take your normal bunker swing
       (including hitting through the sand)
     * Hold your finish position with your body facing the target
   - Distance control:
     * After perfecting the above...
     * Short: hands move from hip height on backswing to hip height on follow through
     * Long: hands move from chest height on backswing to chest height on follow through
     * Long: consider using a 50° or 60° wedge
   - For firm sand:
     * Use chopping motion into the sand
     * Throw the heel of the club firmly into the sand (not using the bounce of the club)

   - Info below is for a 15-20 yard bunker shot
   - Ball off the front foot
   - Most of your weight over the front foot
   - Open stance
   - Flare out the front foot
   - Virtually a full swing, ~70mph club head speed (not a weak 35mph)
   - Face open by ~30 degrees
   - Hit the sand 6-7" behind ball (not 2" as commonly recommended)

1. [Top Speed Golf - Clay Ballard | Best Bunker Tips | How to Play Bunkers - Hard or Soft Sand (video) | 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVqWoduC-tk)
   - 0m32s: Soft sand (15m / 50 foot shot):
     * Face open, ~45°
     * Wide stance (dig your shoes into the sand)
     * Ball forward in stance
     * Weight on front foot
     * Swing vertical / thump the sand
     * Hit the sand 4-6" behind ball
     * Big/full swing [with follow through and body facing target]
   - 5m05s: **Hard/wet sand** (15m / 50 foot shot):
     * **Face less open, ~30°**
     * Hit the sand closer to the ball; 2-4" behind ball
     * **Hit down to penetrate the wet, hard sand**
     * Swing ultra-aggressive (even more aggressive than soft sand because you are trying to penetrate the hard sand) / thump the sand
     * Other aspects as for soft sand [including big/full swing with follow through and body facing target]

   - [Bunker Play Videos (playlist) | 2020-2022](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwe4RNi5wcrpH2M4V7sug9MoyjsQpEApp)
   - Good setup; your left hand can touch your left knee
   - Not much body turn needed
   - Important: You need a lot of club head speed; very wristy; very "armsy"
   - A lot of wrist hinge during the backswing; "3 sides of a square"; club head has travelled
     a long way; club shaft is a short distance from body
   - Wrists re-hinge during the follow through; "3 sides of a square"; club head finishes high

1. [Kerrod Gray Golf | BUNKER SETUP MISTAKES AND HOW TO FIX THEM (video) | 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hky9kzOEmEk)
   - Mistake #1: Standing too tall and too narrow. Instead...
     * Wide stance with lots of knee flex (and front toe flare)
     * Gives lots of stability
     * Improves the opportunity to hit the sand
     * When combined with speed, it gives a good chance to get the ball out
     * Once the swing is complete, the knees are still flexed and body is still low
   - Mistake #2: Shift weight to the left side by moving hips left but upper body right. Instead...
     * After taking a wide-low stance as above, slide your left hand down to your left kneecap
     * This ensures shoulders are level and chest is over the ball
     * Allows you to keep your weight on the left side
   - Mistake #3: Handle forward at address (i.e. forward shaft lean). Instead...
     * Handle should point towards the center of the body (e.g. belt buckle) at address
     * Helps prevent the leading edge of the club head from digging into the sand

1. [Kerrod Gray Golf - Kerrod Gray & Matt Ballard | This Bunker Tip Changed Everything (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PXSjBxZRMI)
   - Start with loft; maintain loft; finish with loft
   - At address the club face is pointing up; you can see this by placing a tee on the face
   - "Mirror-mirror" wrist action drill:
     * pretend the club face is a mirror
     * when the club shaft is horizontal during the backswing the mirror should be (roughly) facing your head
     * when the club shaft is horizontal during the follow through the mirror should be (roughly) facing your head
   - Not a wide-swing, instead soft/bent elbows during backswing and follow through
   - Accelerate with long follow through of club head (but not hands)
   - Lead/left leg remains flexed during the backswing a well past impact
   - Drill:
     * Left arm horizontally in front of you
     * Swing the club with the trail/right arm
     * The right wrist should hinge (backswing) and re-hinge (follow through) finishing with a vertical shaft
       while the left arm remains in the original position

1. [Aussie Golf Pros | How To Play Bunker Shots - The Basics (video) | 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDdixGbTVkQ)
   - Long swing (close to full power) because the sand absorbs so much of the club's energy
   - Ball in the center of a shoe-sized divot; not 1-2 inches because it is too difficult
     to accurately hit that close
   - Use the bounce of the sand wedge
     * vertical shaft, i.e. no forward shaft lean
     * open the club face
   - Dig/wiggle your feet into the sand for a firmer stance

1. [Aussie Golf Pros | Hard Sand (video) | 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY3zL-oiqCE)
   - Practice these techniques for firm/compacted/wet sand
   - Method 1:
     * Do not open the club face (because we don't want the club to bounce off the hard sand)
     * We want the leading edge of the club to dig into the sand and get under the ball
       (because we still do not want to make contact with the ball)
     * For more ball height, use a lob wedge if you have one; this also has the advantage
       that the lob wedge does not have much bounce
   - Method 2:
     * Open the club face of the sand wedge for more loft
     * Stand further from the golf ball
     * Address the ball so the toe of the club is up in the air (so the heel enters the sand first);
       this prevents the club from bouncing off the hard sand
     * Hit down into the sand firmly
     * This method adds height and spin

1. [AliTaylorGolf | See Just How EASY Bunker Shots Can Be - (Out EVERY Time) (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZXEA4Xkv8Y)
   - Basic technique to get out of the bunker
     * Use about 56-60° wedge with bounce
     * Ball position further forward than usual
     * Club
       + Hold at the top of the grip
       + **Square club face**
     * Stance
       + Stance square
       + Wider stance than usual
       + Flex the left knee
       + Weight on the left foot
     * **Take a fairly full swing**
       + He has a good follow through
       + He has a good body rotation
     * Practice without a ball
       + Take a fairly full swing
       + Observe where your club enters the sand
       + Observe how much sand you take
       + Observe how far the sand gets tossed onto the green
       + Get used to the feeling of hitting the sand
   - How to control distance from the bunker? Try to keep most of the technique the same as above, but change...
     * Length (speed) of the swing
     * Loft of the club
       + 60° wedge and/or open club face for shorter shots
       + hands lower for more loft and shorter shots
       + pitching wedge or 9 iron with open face (to create a bounce) for longer shots
   - If the sand is firm/compact, keep the club head square

   - [Short version](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kWpPdWtEP-I)
   - Three fundamentals
     * Open up the club face
     * Accelerate through the ball
     * Hit the sand first
   - Also
     * The club should enter the sand along a line which is level with your left heel (and the ball will be left of that line)
     * For *standard* bunker shots, she tries to always keep the same swing and *only change the loft* to hit a different distance
     * Squat onto the left side
     * She prefers the hands to be in the middle of the grip
     * Do not sway left and right
     * Do not rotate the club face; the face should finish open (pointing to the sky)

   - Lesson for beginner golfers...
   - Ball position is inside the left heel (or a ball or two inside of that)
   - Stance
     + Stance is open to the target line by 20-30°
     + Stance 2-3" wider than for your 7-8 iron
     + Posture low
   - Club
     + Open the club face to about 1:30 to 2 o'clock
     + Hands are in the middle (i.e. neutral/vertical shaft)
   - Swing
     + Hit the sand first
     + **The length of sand taken should be about the length of a dollar bill; test with practice**
     + **Enter the sand 1-2" behind the golf ball; test with practice**
     + **You must maintain 60% of your weight on your left foot throughout the whole backswing and forward swing**
       - **you must not shift your weight to the right during your backswing**
       - drill: practice with a tennis ball under your right heel

   1. Square club face (to get the club face under the firm surface of the sand)
   2. Shallow angle of attack (to prevent the club head from "bouncing off the hard sand" he says)
   3. Quiet body (for better contact, more accurate entry point and small divot)
   4. Shorter swing (for better contact)
   5. Slower swing (for more control)

     + Loft
     + Length and/or Speed of Swing
     + V-Shaped vs. U-Shaped... A V-shaped swing is where the player actively hinges the wrist abruptly and unhinges them just as quick near impact... With this technique the body should stay relatively still and passive
   * [Use the right club and vary swing length](https://backswing.com/roundup/greenside-bunker-swing/#83147)
     + The two most important keys to being a good bunker player is consistent entry point into the sand and consistent depth of cut. When you use more loft than you need you’ll need a bigger swing. The bigger your swing the harder it is to repeat these. Try a less lofted wedge and make the swing shorter.
     + ...try to keep the length of the backswing short and the speed through the sand up
     + ...the longer the ball is in the air–the more it will tend to fade
   * [Distance control in Greenside Sand](https://backswing.com/roundup/greenside-bunker-swing/#83143)
     + If the technique is sound, the ball will go exactly in the direction the sand goes. After that it’s all about making the sand go different distances. Ultimately the distance the sand goes is directly related to the amount of force applied to it. This may come from from many different applications such as swing size, varying follow through lengths, different clubs, etc.
     + Get in that bunker without a ball and get really good at moving that sand a desired distance and direction.
   * [Easiest Shot in Golf](https://backswing.com/roundup/greenside-bunker-swing/#83160)
     + Open the club to the desired open face and face your top hand with palm up. The lower hand will be the same. This will keep the club face open thru the swing.
   * [Better Bunker Play](https://backswing.com/roundup/greenside-bunker-swing/#83166)
     + In order to execute a proper bunker shot, practice “flopping” the ball over a bunker to better understand how the sand wedge works. Proper shaft angle at address, grip pressure and “using the bounce” are key elements and can simplify the fear of this shot.

   - A bunker shot technique which is quite different from the one which most coaches teach
   - I agree with not opening the club face too much
   - I agree with not getting too low (i.e. stance not too wide)
   - However for me, taking an ordinary swing makes it more difficult to get an accurate entry point into the sand.
     I prefer minimal body and arm movement during the backswing and downswing and use a wristy swing (with a good
     follow through and body turning towards the target).

## Summary

For a flat lie in soft sand...

### Very short version
- open the club face (but for me, only to about 1 o'clock)
- ball forward in stance (but for me, only slightly forward of center)
- weight on front foot and keep it there (i.e. do not sway back during
  the backswing and forward during the downswing)
- no forward shaft lean
- **address the ball with the club head hovering above the sand a few inches
  behind the intended entry point into the sand** (see "My tips" below)
- **take a good length, wristy backswing / wristy follow through**
- **generate a lot of club head speed at impact with the sand**
- make first contact with the sand about 2" behind the ball
- **I try to keep the legs and head very quiet/still during the backswing
  and downswing**
- **rotate your body and finish facing the target**

### Detailed version

- We must "engage the bounce" of the sand wedge, hence:
  * ball forward in stance *[but for me, only slightly forward of center]*
  * weight on front foot *[yes]*
  * shaft must be vertical at address when viewed from the front;
    i.e. no forward shaft lean *[yes]*
  * open the club face and keep the club face open during downswing, impact and follow
    through *[but for me at address, only open to 1 o'clock or 30°]*
  * fold arms and hinge wrists during backswing; fold arms and re-hinge wrists during
    follow through (which means the hands don't usually get very high) *[yes]*
- Since we are going to hit the sand and not the ball, this requires a lot of energy, hence:
  * take a good length, wristy backswing / wristy follow through *[yes]*
  * generate a lot of club head speed at impact with the sand *[yes]*
  * thump the sand *[yes]*
  * make first contact with the sand about 2" behind the ball *[yes]*
  * take a shallow divit (about 1" deep) *[yes]*
  * continue with a wristy follow through *[yes]*
  * rotate your body and finish facing the target *[yes]*
- So we have plenty of loft to get the ball out of the bunker:
  * use a wide stance which brings the body and hands low *[but not too wide]*
  * make a fairly steep backswing by:
    + breaking the wrists (so the arms and shaft form an "L" shape *[yes]*
    + take the club up (not too far back behind your body) *[probably]*
- Also:
  * dig/grind your feet into the sand (for stability) *[yes]*
  * grip down the shaft for more control (and to compensate for
    'low hands' due to digging feet into sand plus the wide stance) *[I
    don't do this because my sand wedge shaft is already very short]*
  * flare the front foot (to promote a follow through) *[I don't do this]*
- My tips:
  * so that I have some level of precision regarding where the club head
    enters the sand, I try to keep the legs and head very quiet/still
    during the backswing and downswing (however I still want to turn to
    face the target during the follow through)
  * the rules of golf do not allow you to touch the sand with your club
    head while addressing the ball.  When I hover my club head above the
    sand at address, I like it to be a few inches behind the point where
    the club head will enter the sand and on the same swing-arc that it
    will be just before it enters the sand during the downswing. In other
    words I have preset my body, shoulder and hand height at address. **Why
    do I do this? I am trying to avoid** putting my club head immediately
    behind the ball but an inch or so above the sand, implying that at
    some point during my backswing and downswing I need to **get the club
    head 2 inches lower than it was at address**. I feel this setup helps
    me to get the club head to enter the sand at a more accurate point.
  * after observing the lie of the ball in the bunker, consider doing
    your practice swing *outside* the bunker to check where you first
    make contact with the ground

1. [Golf.com - Kevin Sprecher | Home Practice: Bunker Splash (video) | 2020](https://golf.com/instruction/bunker-shots/home-practice-bunker-splash/)
   - Drill 1 (sand required, but no bunker needed):
     * Use a plastic, wooden or similar board
     * Put a small pile of sand onto the board
     * Erase the sand from the board with your bunker-swing
       + Feel the club thump the board
       + Turn body towards target during the finish
       + See sand splashed out of the so-called "bunker"
   - Drill 2 (sand required, but no bunker needed):
     * As for drill 1, but:
       + place a ball on the pile of sand
       + swing as before
     * [You may require a net or limited flight (foam or hollow) practice ball if you are doing this at home]
   - Drill 3 (bunker *is* required):
     * As for drill 2, but
       + make a small pile of sand *in the bunker* 
       + place a ball on the pile of sand
       + swing as before

1. [GolfWRX forum | DIY Bunker Practice at home | 2014](https://forums.golfwrx.com/topic/1093346-diy-bunker-practice-at-home/)
   - Scrap wood with sand placed on top. (Place the ball on a cup of sand off plywood.)
   - Your child's sandbox/sandpit
   - Dig a hole and fill it with a 50 pound bag of sand
   - Tear a hole/strip in the top of the bag of sand and hit out of the bag
     * Disadvantage: apparently, the end of the bag becomes a lip which gets in the way of your swing
     * "The first few shots did feel authentic"
   - Just hit flop shots off of a piece of carpet remnant, same principle.
   - Emptying a bag of sand into a pan
   - Aside: Bunker game idea:
     * on every hole which has one, aim for one of the green side bunkers
     * if you accidentally hit the green, you must putt off the green into one of the bunkers before completing the hole

   - [Arthur Lovin | Sand trap practice device; US4535989A | 1984](https://patents.google.com/patent/US4535989)
     * Tray large enough for golfer and ball (e.g. 6'x7')
     * Foldable sheet above the tray and outside the tray (forming an apron to catch most of the sand)
     * Sand placed above the sheet and within the tray
     * Usage:
       + "A golfer can then practice hitting balls out of the sand.
       + The sand scattered by the golfer's swings falls on the apron, which can then be lifted
         over the tray to return the sand to the tray's interior.
       + When the apparatus is not in use, the sheet is simply folded up over the sand, thereby
         protecting the sand from the elements."
   - [William Andrew Young | Sand trap practice device; US5730660A | 1996](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5730660A/en)
     * Trough (e.g. 6"x16") filled with sand
     * Sides of trough show where club head should enter and exit the sand
     * "The base of the practice device will not permit the club to dig into the sand to an
       excessive amount such that the ball will come out of the bunker with every swing.
     * The base also serves as a feedback mechanism indicating to the golfer when the swing
       is improper and the club face is too deep in the sand if the club strikes the base."
