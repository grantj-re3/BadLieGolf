   - Discusses the background and reasons for the drills
     * In his research, he used club head speed to assess how good a swing is from a mechanical perspective:
       + as higher club head speeds are correlated with lower handicaps
       + if you are not moving your body properly you will not be able to achieve a high club head speed
       + hence by analysing the data he was able to determine the principles of a good golf swing (i.e. a
         swing with high club head speed)
     * The practice drills are intended to:
       + promote these "good golf swing" principles
       + be practical
       + be easy
       + be intuitive & instinctive
   - Better swing pattern: "GRANDIOSE"
     * "GRAND" - 5 swing principles
       + Ground up
       + Rhythmic
       + Asynchronous i.e. "separation" meaning that "upper body turn" and "lower body shift" are not occurring at the same time
       + Natural
       + Dynamic
     * "IO" - scientific foundation of the GRAND swing
       + Impulse smart
       + Orchestrated i.e. coordination and sequence
     * "SE"
       + Safe i.e. a mechanically robust swing should be safe by allowing the large muscles (in the lower body) generate speed while
         the smaller muscles (in the upper body e.g. hands and arms) work on the small jobs
       + Effective & efficient i.e. maximise outcome without effort
   - An improved swing pattern should have a "pleasant side effect" of increasing the club head speed
   - Stage 1, 2, 3 + X drills
     * Initially practice the rhythm by using steps, then elimiate the steps while maintaining the rhythm
     * Stage 1 & 2 drills have a "trigger motion" which is throwing the club towards the target first; this promotes a more active backswing
     * The drills help to prevent you from rushing the down swing (with arms)
     * The drills encourage you to move your body weight properly during the swing (i.e. good movement pattern/sequence)
     * The drills are not compatible with an "arm-driven" swing
     * For the step drills, you need to develop a body-driven backswing and a body-driven down swing
     * Stage 1 is a two-step swing drill
     * Stage 2 is a one-step swing drill
     * Stage 3 is a zero-step swing

   - Swing drill
   - I have noticed that this repetition has vastly **improved my balance** during my swing!

   - Similar to Dr Kwon
   - Most professional golfers have up-tempo swings
   - Step drill
   - Convert step drill into real swing
   - Drill: Add towel [or club head cover] to make club head heavier

1. [Be Better Golf | THE DOWN AND AROUND MOVE! Milo Lines: "MY KEYS to BE BETTER" (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXjm3nvyylU)
   - Similar to Dr Kwon
   - Right shoulder does backstoke (not freestyle)
   - Spine moves to produce backswing/downswing. Spine angle is not constant.
   - What powers the swing? "**Left side of body** moving down and around" [together]
   - Build pattern first: Club stays out and away; body turns.
   - Then step drills
