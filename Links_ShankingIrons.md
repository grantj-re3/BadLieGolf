# How to stop shanking irons

If you are hitting irons low and 45° or so to the right (for a right handed
player) then it is probably due to a shank (hitting the ball with the hosel).
If you expect a cure from the links below, you should first ensure that
the fault is due to a shank and not something else (like hitting the ball
off the toe of the club)! You may be able to look for ball impact marks by:
- cleaning your club face then looking for strike marks after impact
- as above but leave a film of water on the club face after cleaning
- fitting impact tape (or some people say masking tape is also ok)
- using Strike Spray Impact Chalk or similar; I have successfully used
  Batiste Dry Shampoo spray (or some people say Dr Scholl's Odor-X, but
  this is not readily available in Australia)

   1. Are you standing too close to the ball?
   1. Awareness and perception of where the ball is
   1. Feel like the contact point will be on the toe
      * *Drill*: Place tee outside the toe of the club face
   1. Is your balance moving towards your toes? [Are you falling towards the ball?]
      * Drill: Lift the toes of both feet during your swing
   1. Is your body tense?
      * Particularly hands, arms, shoulders, chest, neck
      * Drill: Practice swings with your eyes closed and be aware of any tension
   1. Hands too far from your body at impact
      * Drill: Use a pool noodle to confirm that the hands do not move too far from your body
   1. Does your club face stay too open?
      * Check the toe of the club points to the sky (or slightly closed?) during the backswing when shaft is parallel to ground

   1. *Check your setup*, 3m04s:
      * Stand in a balanced position at address. Don't stand too close or too far from the ball.
        + Stand up straight
        + Club parallel with the ground
        + Handle (i.e. left hand) is about a hand-and-thumb distance from belt buckle
        + Tilt from the hips until the club touches the ground
        + Slightly flex the knees
      * Close eyes and feel equal weight between toes and heel
      * Dangle right arm (so it does not hold the club); you should be able to move the right hand onto the handle
        without any manipulation (i.e. by just moving the hand towards the target; not towards or away from your body)
   1. Check your club face isn't open, 5m04s:
      * Check the club face is *parallel to your spine angle* during the backswing when shaft is parallel to ground
   1. Build awareness of where the ball strikes the face, 6m16s:
      * Drill: Place a second ball [or tee] outside the toe of the club face

   - Setup: Weight towards the heels of your feet
   - Backswing: Stay on your heels
   - Downswing: Stay on your heels as you push your butt back

   - If your ball flight is low and 45° or so to the right, it is likely that the ball is
     hitting the hosel ... and it is unlikely that:
     * you are striking the ball at the toe of the club, or
     * striking the ball with the club face way-open (as this would result in a high shot)
   - Cure drill:
     * Get an empty cardboard box such as a long box that the clubs are packed in
       (alternatively a shoe box is ok; it needs to be *pretty tall*)
     * Place the box parallel to the target line
     * Place the ball near the box so there is only ⅛" between the toe of the club and the box
     * Use a problem club; typically a lofted iron
     * Strike the ball without touching the box
     * Repeat ... and try to diagnose the cause
     * Aside 1: If you think you may be hitting off the toe (hence not hitting the box) then put
       a hand towel (or head cover) on the shaft-side of the ball with quite a bit of margin so
       the shaft doesn't hit the towel (maybe 2" from the bottom of the hosel?) and ensure the
       club path is between the box and the towel
     * Aside 2: This can also be a great training aid for the driver
   - Causes: Video yourself from behind the target line to see if you can spot any of these causes.
     * Downswing is too much outside-to-in (most common) often caused by a *flat* take away
     * Downswing is too much inside-to-out
     * Flat take away
     * Take away where the hands get too far from the body
     * The head moves down during take away (and stays down); often due to a low take away;
       often associated with low handicap players
     * The head moves down during transition
   - Cure take away: Feel like your arms are on top of your chest
   - Hitting the heel with a wood/driver will not cause a shank, it will cause a low shot
   - Shanking is mental as well as physical
   - If you are on the driving range shanking every lofted iron, do something else (something
     productive). E.g. Hit a 5 wood or long iron or practice chipping.

   - Use proper golf posture:
     * Stand up straight
     * Put hands on our thighs
     * Hinge our thighs back until our toes come up
     * Add a little flex to our knees

     * Common cause: During the takeaway, the club head moves too far to the inside
     * Move the club head and handle in the same direction during takeaway
       + Do not break the wrists (much) during the takeaway
     * Drill: Use Plane Slider (with a weight which slides up/down the shaft) to confirm backswing goes up (fairly vertical)

     * Why are you shanking your chip shots?
       + Forward shaft lean is excessive, or
       + During the takeaway, the club head moves too far to the inside

   - Drill:
     * Alignment stick with one end in the ground and other end pointing towards the target
     * Other end is halfway between right knee and ground and just inside your shin
     * During downswing the right shin should not touch the alignment stick;
       instead the lower right leg should move left then rotate (i.e. right knee
       points towards your left knee)

1. [GolfUniversity - Lawrie Montague | How to Eliminate the Chipping and Pitching Shanks (video) | 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Hf3o9aPXW4)
   - Keep the club head in front of your body the whole time (backswing and downswing) when pitching
   - Cocking the wrists is ok
   - Do not roll the wrists (i.e. open the club face); the toe of the club should point to the sky
     during the backswing when shaft is parallel to ground

1. [GolfUniversity - Matt Cleverdon | How to Overcome the Pitching Shanks (video) | 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozFQ8Cm26Q)
   - To avoid falling forward, consider hitting the pitch with your left foot toes "in the air"

1. Me
   - Symptoms:
     * I have a tendancy to shank full-shot and three-quarter-shot
       wedges, e.g. pitching wedge, gap wedge, sand wedge
     * Sometimes I have shanked 3 or 4 wedges while playing 18 holes!
   - The following seems to work for me:
     * At address, bias the ball towards the toe of the club.
       Typically, I align the middle of the club face with the
       near edge of the ball (instead of the middle of the ball).
     * I have poor balance when hitting full shots and tend to fall
       towards the ball. Hence, concentrate on feeling my weight
       more towards my heels at:
       + address
       + backswing
       + downswing


# The opposite problem: hitting off the club face toe
