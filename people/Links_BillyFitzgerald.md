## Transition

1. [Transition ➡️ Impact: Downswing Sequencing (video) | 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmuh5rqjrOs)
   - Feel a preset impact position
     * left hip pushed away from the ball
     * right forearm is aligned with the shaft
   - Take very short swings ensuring you go through the impact position
   - When you arrive at impact from transition (a full swing) feel that 85% of your body is behind the ball
   - The lead leg pushes the lead hip back which:
     * pulls the trail side (thigh, knee and foot) towards the ball
     * pulls the arms towards the impact position
     * shallows the club plane
   - Don't be so quick to get off your right side
   - Recap: The lead leg/hip pulls the trail side towards impact
     (not the trail side pushing to the lead side and impact)

1. [Transition: Sit to start your downswing (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4hHiqLKXcA)
   - The move to the left side occurs much earlier than the arm downswing
   - This move causes the spine to tilt away from the target
   - At transition as you sit/squat/back into the target,
     feel how your spine shallows your plane in the downswing
     and your arms come down without any effort
   - At about P6 you can "go" [i.e. apply maximum rotation effort?]
   - As your right hip socket goes back, feel like you "back into the target"
   - Let the arms hang loose
