# Backspin on chips and pitch shots

## Summary - How to achieve spin

The main factors affecting spin when it comes to technique are:
- angle of attack
- dynamic loft (the amount of loft presented to the ball at impact)
- speed

Combining angle of attack with dynamic loft gives *spin loft*. You can think of it as:
- if the angle of attack and the path of the club face are both in the same direction,
  then spin loft is 0° and no backspin will be applied to the ball
- as the angle between these two paths becomes wider, the spin loft increases hence
  more spin is applied (until the angle is so great that friction is reduced and
  slippage between the ball and club face increases)

The ball will spin more if the equipment, conditions and technique all encourage good grip (friction)
between the ball and the club face.

1. Equipment
   - Premium golf ball (typically a high-ish compression ball with a soft, thin cover)
   - Modern wedge with grooves in good condition (not worn)

1. Conditions
   - *Short fairway-length grass or a bare-lie* to allow you to strike the ball low on the
     club face and not allow grass to get between ball and club
   - *Clean and dry club face/grooves* to improve grip/friction between club and ball
   - *Dry ball* to improve grip/friction between club and ball
   - *Dry lie* (hitting area) to improve grip/friction between club and ball, and allow you
     to strike the ball low on the club face
   - *Soft green* (landing area) is ideal for reacting to spin [apparently]; however, spin
     is probably of greatest benefit on hard greens to prevent the ball from rolling off

1. Technique
   - Most of the coaches in these videos are using wedges with 58-60° of loft.
   - Mid-range *spin loft*, around 55°. (Note that a ball hit with a lot of loft will also stop
     fairly quickly because it lands at a near-vertical angle, not because of spin.)
   - Have a small amount (less than the bounce angle of the wedge) of forward shaft lean.
     5° of shaft lean will engage the bounce for a wedge with 10° of bounce.
   - At address the club face can be square or open depending on how much spin you are wanting to
     apply.
   - During the swing, brush the ground with the wedge, i.e. either hit cleanly or take a
     small and shallow divot *after* striking the ball.
   - Strike the ball near the bottom of the club face, i.e. 2-5 grooves from the bottom.
   - Striking the ball at high speed will apply more spin. Hence, hold the club with a
     light grip (i.e. "soft hands").

   - Shaft lean (maybe 15°) for all shots above about 40 yards
   - Low ball flight; mid-40° launch angle with 60° wedge
