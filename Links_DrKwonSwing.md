   - Discusses the background and reasons for the drills
     * In his research, he used club head speed to assess how good a swing is from a mechanical perspective:
       + as higher club head speeds are correlated with lower handicaps
       + if you are not moving your body properly you will not be able to achieve a high club head speed
       + hence by analysing the data he was able to determine the principles of a good golf swing (i.e. a
         swing with high club head speed)
     * The practice drills are intended to:
       + promote these "good golf swing" principles
       + be practical
       + be easy
       + be intuitive & instinctive
   - Better swing pattern: "GRANDIOSE"
     * "GRAND" - 5 swing principles
       + Ground up
       + Rhythmic
       + Asynchronous i.e. "separation" meaning that "upper body turn" and "lower body shift" are not occurring at the same time
       + Natural
       + Dynamic
     * "IO" - scientific foundation of the GRAND swing
       + Impulse smart
       + Orchestrated i.e. coordination and sequence
     * "SE"
       + Safe i.e. a mechanically robust swing should be safe by allowing the large muscles (in the lower body) generate speed while
         the smaller muscles (in the upper body e.g. hands and arms) work on the small jobs
       + Effective & efficient i.e. maximise outcome without effort
   - An improved swing pattern should have a "pleasant side effect" of increasing the club head speed
   - Stage 1, 2, 3 + X drills
     * Initially practice the rhythm by using steps, then elimiate the steps while maintaining the rhythm
     * Stage 1 & 2 drills have a "trigger motion" which is throwing the club towards the target first; this promotes a more active backswing
     * The drills help to prevent you from rushing the down swing (with arms)
     * The drills encourage you to move your body weight properly during the swing (i.e. good movement pattern/sequence)
     * The drills are not compatible with an "arm-driven" swing
     * For the step drills, you need to develop a body-driven backswing and a body-driven down swing
     * Stage 1 is a two-step swing drill
     * Stage 2 is a one-step swing drill
     * Stage 3 is a zero-step swing

   - **Stage 1: Two-step swing drill**
   - Sequence (for right hander):
     * Start with club in hand & feet together
     * Trigger motion: Throw the club forward towards the target (i.e. the opposite direction compared to the backswing)
     * When the club reaches its apex (when club head about shoulder height) take a small step right (with the right foot)
     * During the backswing (when hands below shoulder height) take a small step left (with the left foot)
     * Complete the backswing
     * Re-center:
       + This is not a big shift left; it is just moving back to the center after the shifting to the trail (right)
         side during the backswing
       + It is discussed and shown by others
         [here](https://www.facebook.com/AthleticMotionGolf/videos/the-recentering-drill-%EF%B8%8F/3322056427825318/),
         [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVst65iNIVM) and
         [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApyvYvPc68Y)
     * Start the down swing & complete the swing
   - Also:
     * The body should make its move *first* so that the step occurs naturally as a result
     * The initial forward swing should be significant (i.e. not small) in order to encourage an *active* backswing
     * Get the feeling that you are putting 99% effort into your backswing and only 80% effort into your down swing.
     * The tempo of each of the 3 parts (forward swing, backswing and down swing) should be about the same duration (i.e. rhythmic).
     * Each step should encourage the body to rotate.
     * It seems Dr Kwon is advocating re-centering at the top of the backswing. However it seems to me that re-centering actually
       starts earlier than this (i.e. when the player takes the second-step).
     * On the down swing, don't open the chest too early.
       + How? Drop the arms early, then turn?
       + The weight must be on your lead (left) side when you rotate

   - **Stage 2: One-step swing drill**
   - Similar to *Stage 1: Two-step swing drill* above:
     * Start with a narrow stance [about half the width of a normal stance]
     * Do not take the first step of the two-step drill (i.e. the trail/right foot does not step)
     * However keep the same tempo/rhythm as the two-step drill
   - Also:
     * You can slow down near the top of your backswing (but not stop) to allow your upper body to shift/re-center
       before starting the down swing
     * On the down swing, don't open the pelvis (or chest) too early.
     * Re-center with your entire trunk (do not lead with your butt or with your shoulders)
     * Rhythm: Respect the inertia of the arms, club and whole body [don't fight the inertia]
   - Interesting rotation demo and discussion: 13m00s - 17m58s

   - **Stage 3: Zero-step swing (i.e. on-course routine)**
   - Count 1-2-3 to feel your tempo/rhythm

   - Swing drill
   - I have noticed that this repetition has vastly **improved my balance** during my swing!

1. [Be Better Golf | Milo Lines, PGA: METHOD TO FIND YOUR SWING. BE Better GOLF! (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke7af8KxAjs)
   - Similar to Dr Kwon
   - Most professional golfers have up-tempo swings
   - Step drill
   - Convert step drill into real swing
   - Drill: Add towel [or club head cover] to make club head heavier

1. [Be Better Golf | THE DOWN AND AROUND MOVE! Milo Lines: "MY KEYS to BE BETTER" (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXjm3nvyylU)
   - Similar to Dr Kwon
   - Right shoulder does backstoke (not freestyle)
   - Spine moves to produce backswing/downswing. Spine angle is not constant.
   - What powers the swing? "**Left side of body** moving down and around" [together]
   - Build pattern first: Club stays out and away; body turns.
   - Then step drills
