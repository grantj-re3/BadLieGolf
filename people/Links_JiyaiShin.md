Several of the ThreeBond YouTube videos are spoken in Japanese and have Japanese subtitles.
To set auto-generated English subtitles, try the following.

- Switch on Closed Captions: E.g. click the Closed Captions icon so a red line appears underneath the icon
- Open settings: Click on the cog
- Auto-translate into English:
  * Click on the Closed Captions line
  * Click Auto-translate. (This option will not appear unless Closed Captions are switched on.)
  * Scroll down then click *English*. DONE!

Some of the auto-generated English subtitles are poor, so...

Thanks to my daughter for the English translation written below. She is not
a golfer, so any mistakes in interpreting golf terminology are my own!
