# The Golf Kinematic Sequence

## Introduction

1. [Titleist Performance Institute: Phil Cheetham | The Linear Kinematic Sequence](https://www.mytpi.com/articles/biomechanics/the-linear-kinematic-sequence)
   - It is known that there is an efficient sequence of motion in a skilled
     golf swing called the Kinematic Sequence. It describes the ...
     sequencing of the rotation speeds of the body segments.
   - Each body segment; pelvis, ribcage and arm sequentially accelerates and
     decelerates before impact, starting from the inner large body segments;
     the pelvis and ribcage, then progressing to the smaller outer segments;
     the arms, hands and club.
   - Each successive segment peaks faster and later than the previous segment.
   - This action causes the club to accelerate rapidly and reach its highest
     speed at impact.
