   * Pace out 20 feet
   * Warm up by:
     + putting with one hand
     + using alignment stick across shoulders
     + feel shoulder rotation is correct
   * Drill:
     + You will be putting from a marked point on the green, through a
       gate to the hole
     + Mark a point on the practice green with sharpie [or ball marker
       or coin which allows you to adjust the position]
     + About a foot in front of the mark, make a "gate" by inserting 2
       tees just wider than the golf ball
     + Lie an alignment stick 3 feet past the hole
     + The objective is to putt from the mark, through the gate and
       either into the hole or beyond the hole but stop before the
       alignment stick
     + Repeat with marker 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 feet behind the gate (21, 22, 23, 24, 25 feet from the hole)
