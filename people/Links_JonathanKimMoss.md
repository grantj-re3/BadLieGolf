   - At transition, turn your chest into your lead arm
     i.e. your arm/club will be delayed compared to your chest turn
   - Helps the downswing throwing action
   - Drill: Feel this lead arm only action: First without a club | Then with a
     inverted/correct orientation club in your lead hand | Then with 2 hands

## Release

1. [BODY AND WRIST RELEASE (video) | 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO3-3ZfzFhc)
   - Release is the point at which the clubhead passes the hands
   - Downswing sequence: Weightshift | Hip rotation | Chest | Arms | Club
   - In the follow through, everything **decelerates** in the same order
     as above to allow the club to move past the arms
   - [4m58] Two ways to check the separation between hips and chest
   - [6m47] Stop-quick drill: When you stop:
     * Chest facing forward
     * Hips turned left
     * Hands near the left pocket
     * Right arm and shaft in a straight line
     * Right shoulder has only turned a little (maybe 20-30°, not 90°)

   - [8m43] Drill

## Follow through / finish

1. [How to Finish Your Golf Swing | Perfect Your Follow-Through for Better Shots (video) | 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgIETq-SEHk)
   - Rotation
   - Extension
   - Weight finishes on the outside heal of the left foot
   - Left hip is beyond the left heal
   - Maintain side bend
   - [5m47] Drill #1: Upper & lower body finish
     * Alignment stick behind lower back
     * Hold there with both forearms
     * Rotate & extend into the finish position (with chest
       pointing left of the target)
     * At the finish, the left hip is above the right hip
   - [8m02] Drill #2: Upper body finish
     * Club horizontal at your chest
     * Two fists holding the grip with palms facing your chest
     * Clubface facing the same direction as your face
     * During follow through, the trail shoulder rotates forward and up
   - [10m21] Balance feel/idea: Prevent your weight from moving towards the ball
     * During the backswing, the right hip goes up [and back] while
       the left hip goes down and across
     * During the downswing, pull the left hip back to match the right
       (not the right hip forward to match the left)
     * This (a) prevents "jamming you up" at impact, (b) gives the
       arms a lot more room to follow through, (c) makes it easier
       to move your weight to the outside heel of the left foot

1. [PERFECT FOLLOW THROUGH WITH 3 MOVES (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMnaMuLw0Y)
   - Pressure/weight shift | Extension | Rotation
   - Drill to get to the "arms horizontal" position

   - Posture | Knee flex | Neck rotation | Tilt
   - Tilt drill: Head gently against a wall (without a club) | During
     the backswing and follow through the head stays against the wall

   - Lack of rotation and lack of extension prevents the arms remaining straight
   - *Extension + rotation during the backswing and follow through*:
     Allows the chest/belt to point higher | Keeps the shoulders moving |
     Allows the arms to move higher while staying straight
   - *Punch drill (for back swing)*: Extend the lead arm down the line
     of your toes | Chest turns | Lead shoulder moves under the chin |
     Bring the trail hand to join the lead hand
   - *Glove under lead-arm drill (for follow through)*:
     Place a glove under your lead armpit | Keep the top of the bicep
     against the side of your chest (not your elbow against your rib cage) |
     Swing from the impact position to almost horizontal arm follow through
     (you must extend to get your arm higher) | *Variations*: Lead arm only;
     Add the trail hand; Add a small backswing | Add a full backswing

## IN to OUT Series

1. :thumbsup: [PART 2: BACKSWING (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyKRRBvgtQY)
   - *Rotation during the backswing*:
     * The lead knee must bend more and the trail knee must straighten more
     * It *feels like* the pelvis moves slightly towards the target
     * Rotating the knees more allows the hips to rotate more
       which allows the chest to rotate more
   - *Hand path/depth during the backswing*: By the time the
     lead arm is parallel to the ground, the grip is aligned
     with the bicep of the trail arm (from the side view)
     i.e. there is some depth behind the body
   - *Lead wrist flex/extension*: Avoid cupping/extending the
     lead wrist during the backswing. This rolls the clubface
     open and will likely make the downswing steep. A neutral
     or bowed/flexed wrist at the top will help the clubhead
     to stay behind (i.e. deeper than) the hands.

## Driver Series

He is often comparing the driver swing to a 7-iron swing, so we can
learn something about iron shots here too.

1. [PART 1: Set Up Position (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdp-flHvhdY)
   - Driver: The ball is *not* on the ground | We do *not*
     want to hit down | The driver is much longer
   - *Iron setup*: Ball position slightly to the left of centre |
     Head is mostly behind the ball | Weight is fairly even
     (about 55% on the lead side) | We hit down on the ball |
     Radius (low point) is in front of the ball
   - *Driver setup*: Weight is same as for an iron (55% on the lead side) |
     (1) Ball position in line with the lead shoulder |
     (2) Stance is wider | (3) Head is further behind the ball |
     (4) Longest/lowest point is at the ball (i.e. at impact)
   - *Iron setup (side view)*: Weight is in the center of the foot |
     Slight knee bend | Hands are directly below the shoulders |
     Flat lower back and slightly rounded upper back |
     Shoulders *not* pinched together
   - *Driver setup (side view)*: Posture is the same as 7-iron |
     (1) Hands are a little outside of the shoulder line (not directly below) |
     (2a) Shoulders must remain parallel to your feet line (even
     though the ball is positioned further forward) | (2b) Forearms
     must also remain in alignment

1. [PART 2: Backswing (video) | 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PP5vA1XTOE)
   - *Chest rotation*: Allows hands to move higher | Allows hands to
     move further behind your body (i.e. depth) | Helps prevent swinging
     "over the top" (resulting in steepness and an out-to-in path) |
     See *HOW TO MAKE ROTATION EASIER IN THE GOLF SWING* link above
   - *Extension*: Not enough extension causes the head to move off the ball |
     ... and limits the height of your hands | Too much extension causes
     a reverse pivot
     * Check point 1: An alignment stick perpendicular to your chest should
       be slightly above horizontal at the top of your backswing
     * Check point 2: At the top of your backswing, there should be a small
       space [say 15cm] between your back and a vertical line above the ball
       (from the front view)
     * Check point 3: At the top of your backswing, your head should not
       have moved left/right (or back/forward)... but it may rotate
   - *Sway*: The hips are permitted to move slightly away from the target
     at the *beginning* of the backswing, but by the time the backswing
     is completed, they should have returned to the address position
     or be slightly closer to the target (i.e. re-centered)
