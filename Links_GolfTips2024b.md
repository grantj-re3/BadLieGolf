   - Let your head move forward (towards the target) during the backswing and keep it there during the down swing and follow through
     * Swing thought
   - Let your chest keep turning during the down swing and follow through
     * Drill: Towel under the arms
     * Swing thought

   - Drills to be done without a ball and with a towel rolled into a tube
   - If you fall forward in the downswing, put the towel-tube under your heels
     and this will train you to push back against the towel and hence stay
     balanced during your swing
   - If you fall backwards in the downswing, put the towel-tube under your toes
     and this will train you to push forward against the towel and hence stay
     balanced during your swing
   - After fixing your balance issues, practice with the towel-tube under the
     arches of your feet
