   - Too much weight on the trail side

   - Setting the club face open
   - Aligning too far open
   - Ball position and weight [IMPORTANT]
   - Length of backswing [check point: shaft points behind the back foot at the top of the backswing]
   - Poor concept of impact [concept: club head travels *forwards* through the sand to carry the parcel
     of sand onto the green; not the concept of hitting down into the sand]

   - How to find your point of contact with the sand (i.e. impact point)
   - On a flat portion of a practice bunker, draw a line in the sand
   - Put your left heel on the line
   - Stand slightly open
   - Club head ahead of the line
   - Address with the butt of the club pointing at your stomach
   - At the top of the backswing (with arms nearly horizontal) shaft points towards the sky
   - Synchronise the chest and arms to land the clubhead exactly on the line
     * If the arms are too fast you will hit the sand before the line
     * If the chest is too fast you will hit the sand after the line
   - It may help if you pause at the top (during the drill)
   - Repeat for uphill/downhill bunker lie

   - Speed
     * Arm swing
     * Shoulder to shoulder swing
     * Plenty of body rotation
   - Open the club face and maintain loft during the swing
   - At the end of the swing, club face should point towards your own face
   - For a longer shot, use a longer wedge
   - Aim for the fat part of the green when necessary
   - Check what sort of sand you are playing from
   - Exaggerate the body rotation

   - Hard sand [I like this technique]
     * Strike the sand with the tow of the club face (hence less resistance by the sand)
     * Upright shaft (handle is high) and steep swing plane
     * Right shoulder is high at address
     * [Narrower/taller stance]
   - Soft sand
     * Strike the sand with the middle of the club face (i.e. middle of the bounce)
     * Lower shaft (handle is low) and shallow swing plane (around the body)
     * Left shoulder is high at address
     * Wider stance

   - Wide stance
   - Open the club face more (to minimise digging); more than 45Â°; he is trying to lie the club head flat on the sand
   - Sternum over the ball
   - Keep as level as possible (to minimise head movement up/down or left/right much)
   - He likes to have his hands low to the ground (near his knees), hence a lot of knee flex
   - Focus on contact [?]
   - Focus on depth of divot (minimal sand)
   - He feels like he is hitting a high cut (which helps make a shallow divot)
   - He makes an aggressive/positive/full-swing strike

   - Problem: Weight too far back.
     * Fix: Put weight on the left heel (instead of left toes) to encourage left hip to open during the follow through.
   - Problem: Too much forward shaft lean at impact.
     * Fix: Take a longer backswing, then wait so that the club head starts the downswing.
     * Fix: Let the club head pass your hands at impact.
   - Problem: Ball too far back.
     * Fix: Place the ball just inside the left heel which will be the center/bottom of the swing arc (when most of your weight is over the left leg).

   - 3m50s In a "properly maintained bunker", for a 10 yard bunker shot you need to swing like a 30 yard shot from the turf (i.e. ratio of 1:3).
   - 26m26s You are not permitted to ground your club in a bunker. So to consistently control the low point of your club during the swing,
     address the ball with the left arm slightly bent (for a right handed player)... then ensure you straighten it during your backswing
     (and keep it straight during your downswing).
   - 32m08s How to hit a bunker shot from a plugged lie? Close the club face so the leading edge of the club does dig into the sand under the ball.
