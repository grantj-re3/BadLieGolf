# My greenside bunker shots

What works for me (in Aug 2024)...

## Soft-to-firm sand

E.g. Soft sand which is slighly damp or slightly compacted

Main setup:

- I prefer my weight towards my heels (and keep it there) <sup>[1]</sup>
- Weight over my lead/left leg (and keep it there)
- Lock my lead/left elbow (and keep it locked until after impact)
- I prefer to address the ball so the centre of the ball is closer to
  the toe of the club head (as I have a tendency to catch too much
  sand and I *feel* I catch less sand this way) <sup>[2]</sup>

Other setup (which I tend to do without thinking):

- Flare the feet
- Dig the feet into the sand
- Slightly open the club face (to about 1 o'clock). You may need
  to open it further to avoid a steep bunker wall and lip.
- Open the stance so that the opened club face points towards
  the target
- Ball in line with my sternum (after I have moved my weight over
  my lead/left leg) ... which implies the ball is closer to the
  left foot than the right
- No forward shaft lean (i.e. sternum, top of handle and bottom
  of shaft are all in a line)
- Right hand grip is very weak (to ensure I do not close the
  club face during the swing)
- I intend to:
  * make first contact with the sand about 2" behind the ball
  * take a dollar-bill length divot which is fairly shallow
  * have the lowest point of my swing under the ball
  * hit forward through the sand 
  * not make contact with the ball at all (unless hitting a
    longer shot)
- Address the ball with the club head hovering above the sand and
  a few inches behind the intended entry point into the sand <sup>[2]</sup>

Motion:

- Almost pause at the top
- **Do not allow the hips to move down as the club head moves down.**
  Instead, rotate the hips while keeping them level during the
  backswing and downswing. <sup>[1]</sup>
- Hit/splash/throw a shallow rectangle-shaped divot of sand several
  metres towards or onto the green
- I try to keep my legs and head very quiet/still during the backswing
  and downswing
- Finish facing the target


Notes:

1. I suspect this is natural for most golfers so is not worthy of a
   special mention for them.
2. I suspect most golfers don't do this.
