   - *The butt of your grip and the center of your chest have to move at the same rate all the time.*
   - *Keep your elbow tucked into your side to help with the movement of your chest and pelvis through the ball.*
   - For longer chips: It's not how much faster you can swing, it's how much bigger you can turn it all together at the same rate.
   - Hit the ground under the ball. The wedge is designed to hit the ground.
   - *Practice with the right arm only.* I feel it improves: Swing tempo | Body rotation | Ball/hand/shaft position | Ground interaction

     * Do not be afraid of making contact with the ground
       + Brush the ground on every practice swing
     * Do not allow the clubhead to move "behind the hands" (moving to the "inside") in the backswing
       + Drill
     * Let your head move forward (towards the target) during the backswing and keep it there during the down swing and follow through
       + Swing thought
     * Let your chest keep turning during the down swing and follow through
       + Drill: Towel under the arms
       + Swing thought

     * Chunk = Fat shot
     * "Pull upward" on the handle as you approach impact (and continue after impact)
     * How? The butt of the handle should get closer to the belt buckle during the downswing and follow through
       + [His finish position looks like T-Rex!]
     * Keep arms relaxed; at address, move the hands up to the belt buckle a couple of times
     * [He has a slow smooth transition where the downswing appears to start due to gravity]

   - 00:00 Intro | 01:40 Chipping 101: <30 yards: Weight on front foot; Hands start ahead/straight line; Low or high? |
     06:35 Ask yourself: Can I hit this off my backfoot? | 09:05 Lob shot: To go vertical when the ground is firm, drive club behind ball |
     10:25 Turn feet slightly towards target to create momentum; Adjust alignment when opening clubface; Adjust shoulder level |
     16:47 Hinge and hold; Accelerate hands past the hip; Hands feel as if they hit front pocket; Keep your hands low |
     18:44 Weight forward; Let face open in the backswing; Come down steep | 22:16 Feet close together |
     24:51 More bounce, more weight forward; Firmer ground, more weight forward; Back-bounce, heel-bounce and toe bounce important when you open the clubface |
     31:08 Make adjustments with upper body, not feet | 32:21 Swing one handed | ...

   - Consider setting the rhythm with a left foot "toe tap" during the take away
   - The knees drive the chipping motion
   - During the downswing and follow through:
     * the right knee rotates to finish alongside the left knee
     * the right heel moves up
     * the left knee straightens a little
   - As a result:
     * the hips and chest will rotate together (minimal "separation")
     * the less work you need to do with your arms

     * Do you shift your weight when you chip? |
       Should your head stay still when you chip?
     * Answer: No, your head/weight should move forward before impact |
       Try a step drill |
       Consider tapping your left foot during the take away

     * Misconception #1: Your weight stays on the left side for the entire swing
     * Fix: Start with about 55% of your weight on your left side |
       Let your pressure move from side-to-side a little bit during the swing |
       Allow your lower body to move fluidly (it should not remain still like putting)
     * Misconception #2: Keep your head down
     * Fix: At release, your body should start to extend and turn | The hip pushes forward | The body moves upward
     * Misconception #3: Impact for chip shot and full swing are the same
     * Fix: When chipping, land the bounce of the clubhead 1 to 1.5 inches behind the ball

## Chip shots: New points

- The butt of your grip and the center of your chest have to move at the same rate all the time
- Keep your elbow tucked into your side
- Move right knee to touch left knee on downswing (to promote hip and chest turn on downswing and follow through)
- Brush the ground a few times to find the low point
- Follow a good swing path (straight or out-to-in); doing right-arm-only practice swings may help
- Lift left toes on backswing (to promote fall left on downswing)
- Try not to move body/shoulders down too much [standing tall seems to help]
